"I went and saw this movie last night after being coaxed to by a few friends of mine. I'll admit that I was reluctant to see it because from what I knew of Ashton Kutcher he was only able to do comedy. I was wrong. Kutcher played the character of Jake Fischer very well, and Kevin Costner played Ben Randall with such professionalism. The sign of a good movie is that it can toy with our emotions. This one did exactly that. The entire theater (which was sold out) was overcome by laughter during the first half of the movie, and were moved to tears during the second half. While exiting the theater I not only saw many women in tears, but many full grown men as well, trying desperately not to let anyone see them crying. This movie was great, and I suggest that you go see it before you judge.",1,went saw movi last night coax friend mine admit reluct see knew ashton kutcher abl comedi wrong kutcher play charact jake fischer well kevin costner play ben randal profession sign good movi toy emot one exactli entir theater sold overcom laughter first half movi move tear second half exit theater not saw mani women tear mani full grown men well tri desper not let anyon see cri movi great suggest go see judg
"Actor turned director Bill Paxton follows up his promising debut, the Gothic-horror ""Frailty"", with this family friendly sports drama about the 1913 U.S. Open where a young American caddy rises from his humble background to play against his Bristish idol in what was dubbed as ""The Greatest Game Ever Played."" I'm no fan of golf, and these scrappy underdog sports flicks are a dime a dozen (most recently done to grand effect with ""Miracle"" and ""Cinderella Man""), but some how this film was enthralling all the same.<br /><br />The film starts with some creative opening credits (imagine a Disneyfied version of the animated opening credits of HBO's ""Carnivale"" and ""Rome""), but lumbers along slowly for its first by-the-numbers hour. Once the action moves to the U.S. Open things pick up very well. Paxton does a nice job and shows a knack for effective directorial flourishes (I loved the rain-soaked montage of the action on day two of the open) that propel the plot further or add some unexpected psychological depth to the proceedings. There's some compelling character development when the British Harry Vardon is haunted by images of the aristocrats in black suits and top hats who destroyed his family cottage as a child to make way for a golf course. He also does a good job of visually depicting what goes on in the players' heads under pressure. Golf, a painfully boring sport, is brought vividly alive here. Credit should also be given the set designers and costume department for creating an engaging period-piece atmosphere of London and Boston at the beginning of the twentieth century.<br /><br />You know how this is going to end not only because it's based on a true story but also because films in this genre follow the same template over and over, but Paxton puts on a better than average show and perhaps indicates more talent behind the camera than he ever had in front of it. Despite the formulaic nature, this is a nice and easy film to root for that deserves to find an audience.",1,actor turn director bill paxton follow promis debut gothic horror frailti famili friendli sport drama u open young american caddi rise humbl background play bristish idol dub greatest game ever play no fan golf scrappi underdog sport flick dime dozen recent done grand effect miracl cinderella man film enthral film start creativ open credit imagin disneyfi version anim open credit hbo carnival rome lumber along slowli first number hour action move u open thing pick well paxton nice job show knack effect directori flourish love rain soak montag action day two open propel plot add unexpect psycholog depth proceed compel charact develop british harri vardon haunt imag aristocrat black suit top hat destroy famili cottag child make way golf cours also good job visual depict goe player head pressur golf pain bore sport brought vividli aliv credit also given set design costum depart creat engag period piec atmospher london boston begin twentieth centuri know go end not base true stori also film genr follow templat paxton put better averag show perhap indic talent behind camera ever front despit formula natur nice easi film root deserv find audienc
"As a recreational golfer with some knowledge of the sport's history, I was pleased with Disney's sensitivity to the issues of class in golf in the early twentieth century. The movie depicted well the psychological battles that Harry Vardon fought within himself, from his childhood trauma of being evicted to his own inability to break that glass ceiling that prevents him from being accepted as an equal in English golf society. Likewise, the young Ouimet goes through his own class struggles, being a mere caddie in the eyes of the upper crust Americans who scoff at his attempts to rise above his standing. <br /><br />What I loved best, however, is how this theme of class is manifested in the characters of Ouimet's parents. His father is a working-class drone who sees the value of hard work but is intimidated by the upper class; his mother, however, recognizes her son's talent and desire and encourages him to pursue his dream of competing against those who think he is inferior.<br /><br />Finally, the golf scenes are well photographed. Although the course used in the movie was not the actual site of the historical tournament, the little liberties taken by Disney do not detract from the beauty of the film. There's one little Disney moment at the pool table; otherwise, the viewer does not really think Disney. The ending, as in ""Miracle,"" is not some Disney creation, but one that only human history could have written.",1,recreat golfer knowledg sport histori pleas disney sensit issu class golf earli twentieth centuri movi depict well psycholog battl harri vardon fought within childhood trauma evict inabl break glass ceil prevent accept equal english golf societi likewis young ouimet goe class struggl mere caddi eye upper crust american scoff attempt rise stand love best howev theme class manifest charact ouimet parent father work class drone see valu hard work intimid upper class mother howev recogn son talent desir encourag pursu dream compet think inferior final golf scene well photograph although cours use movi not actual site histor tournament littl liberti taken disney not detract beauti film one littl disney moment pool tabl otherwis viewer not realli think disney end miracl not disney creation one human histori could written
"I saw this film in a sneak preview, and it is delightful. The cinematography is unusually creative, the acting is good, and the story is fabulous. If this movie does not do well, it won't be because it doesn't deserve to. Before this film, I didn't realize how charming Shia Lebouf could be. He does a marvelous, self-contained, job as the lead. There's something incredibly sweet about him, and it makes the movie even better. The other actors do a good job as well, and the film contains moments of really high suspense, more than one might expect from a movie about golf. Sports movies are a dime a dozen, but this one stands out. <br /><br />This is one I'd recommend to anyone.",1,saw film sneak preview delight cinematographi unusu creativ act good stori fabul movi not well deserv film realiz charm shia lebouf could marvel self contain job lead someth incred sweet make movi even better actor good job well film contain moment realli high suspens one might expect movi golf sport movi dime dozen one stand one recommend anyon
"Bill Paxton has taken the true story of the 1913 US golf open and made a film that is about much more than an extra-ordinary game of golf. The film also deals directly with the class tensions of the early twentieth century and touches upon the profound anti-Catholic prejudices of both the British and American establishments. But at heart the film is about that perennial favourite of triumph against the odds.<br /><br />The acting is exemplary throughout. Stephen Dillane is excellent as usual, but the revelation of the movie is Shia LaBoeuf who delivers a disciplined, dignified and highly sympathetic performance as a working class Franco-Irish kid fighting his way through the prejudices of the New England WASP establishment. For those who are only familiar with his slap-stick performances in ""Even Stevens"" this demonstration of his maturity is a delightful surprise. And Josh Flitter as the ten year old caddy threatens to steal every scene in which he appears.<br /><br />A old fashioned movie in the best sense of the word: fine acting, clear directing and a great story that grips to the end - the final scene an affectionate nod to Casablanca is just one of the many pleasures that fill a great movie.",1,bill paxton taken true stori us golf open made film much extra ordinari game golf film also deal directli class tension earli twentieth centuri touch upon profound anti cathol prejudic british american establish heart film perenni favourit triumph odd act exemplari throughout stephen dillan excel usual revel movi shia laboeuf deliv disciplin dignifi highli sympathet perform work class franco irish kid fight way prejudic new england wasp establish familiar slap stick perform even steven demonstr matur delight surpris josh flitter ten year old caddi threaten steal everi scene appear old fashion movi best sens word fine act clear direct great stori grip end final scene affection nod casablanca one mani pleasur fill great movi
"I saw this film on September 1st, 2005 in Indianapolis. I am one of the judges for the Heartland Film Festival that screens films for their Truly Moving Picture Award. A Truly Moving Picture ""...explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life."" Heartland gave that award to this film.<br /><br />This is a story of golf in the early part of the 20th century. At that time, it was the game of upper class and rich ""gentlemen"", and working people could only participate by being caddies at country clubs. With this backdrop, this based-on-a-true-story unfolds with a young, working class boy who takes on the golf establishment and the greatest golfer in the world, Harry Vardon.<br /><br />And the story is inspirational. Against all odds, Francis Ouimet (played by Shia LaBeouf of ""Holes"") gets to compete against the greatest golfers of the U.S. and Great Britain at the 1913 U.S. Open. Francis is ill-prepared, and has a child for a caddy. (The caddy is hilarious and motivational and steals every scene he appears in.) But despite these handicaps, Francis displays courage, spirit, heroism, and humility at this world class event.<br /><br />And, we learn a lot about the early years of golf; for example, the use of small wooden clubs, the layout of the short holes, the manual scoreboard, the golfers swinging with pipes in their mouths, the terrible conditions of the greens and fairways, and the play not being canceled even in torrential rain.<br /><br />This film has stunning cinematography and art direction and editing. And with no big movie stars, the story is somehow more believable.<br /><br />This adds to the inventory of great sports movies in the vein of ""Miracle"" and ""Remember the Titans.""<br /><br />FYI - There is a Truly Moving Pictures web site where there is a listing of past winners going back 70 years.",1,saw film septemb st indianapoli one judg heartland film festiv screen film truli move pictur award truli move pictur explor human journey artist express hope respect posit valu life heartland gave award film stori golf earli part th centuri time game upper class rich gentlemen work peopl could particip caddi countri club backdrop base true stori unfold young work class boy take golf establish greatest golfer world harri vardon stori inspir odd franci ouimet play shia labeouf hole get compet greatest golfer u great britain u open franci ill prepar child caddi caddi hilari motiv steal everi scene appear despit handicap franci display courag spirit heroism humil world class event learn lot earli year golf exampl use small wooden club layout short hole manual scoreboard golfer swing pipe mouth terribl condit green fairway play not cancel even torrenti rain film stun cinematographi art direct edit no big movi star stori somehow believ add inventori great sport movi vein miracl rememb titan fyi truli move pictur web site list past winner go back year
"Maybe I'm reading into this too much, but I wonder how much of a hand Hongsheng had in developing the film. I mean, when a story is told casting the main character as himself, I would think he would be a heavy hand in writing, documenting, etc. and that would make it a little biased.<br /><br />But...his family and friends also may have had a hand in getting the actual details about Hongsheng's life. I think the best view would have been told from Hongsheng's family and friends' perspectives. They saw his transformation and weren't so messed up on drugs that they remember everything.<br /><br />As for Hongsheng being full of himself, the consistencies of the Jesus Christ pose make him appear as a martyr who sacrificed his life (metaphorically, of course, he's obviously still alive as he was cast as himself) for his family's happiness. Huh?<br /><br />The viewer sees him at his lowest points while still maintaining a superiority complex. He lies on the grass coming down from (during?) a high by himself and with his father, he contemplates life and has visions of dragons at his window, he celebrates his freedom on a bicycle all while outstretching his arms, his head cocked to the side.<br /><br />It's fabulous that he's off of drugs now, but he's no hero. He went from a high point in his career in acting to his most vulnerable point while on drugs to come back somewhere in the middle.<br /><br />This same device is used in Ted Demme's ""Blow"" where the audience empathizes with the main character who is shown as a flawed hero.<br /><br />However, ""Quitting"" (""Zuotian"") is a film that is recommended, mostly for its haunting soundtrack, superb acting, and landscapes. But, the best part is the feeling that one gets when what we presume to be the house of Jia Hongsheng is actually a stage setting for a play. It makes the viewer feel as if Hongsheng's life was merely a play told in many difficult parts.",1,mayb read much wonder much hand hongsheng develop film mean stori told cast main charact would think would heavi hand write document etc would make littl bias famili friend also may hand get actual detail hongsheng life think best view would told hongsheng famili friend perspect saw transform mess drug rememb everyth hongsheng full consist jesu christ pose make appear martyr sacrif life metaphor cours obvious still aliv cast famili happi huh viewer see lowest point still maintain superior complex lie grass come high father contempl life vision dragon window celebr freedom bicycl outstretch arm head cock side fabul drug no hero went high point career act vulner point drug come back somewher middl devic use ted demm blow audienc empath main charact shown flaw hero howev quit zuotian film recommend mostli haunt soundtrack superb act landscap best part feel one get presum hous jia hongsheng actual stage set play make viewer feel hongsheng life mere play told mani difficult part
"I felt this film did have many good qualities. The cinematography was certainly different exposing the stage aspect of the set and story. The original characters as actors was certainly an achievement and I felt most played quite convincingly, of course they are playing themselves, but definitely unique. The cultural aspects may leave many disappointed as a familiarity with the Chinese and Oriental culture will answer a lot of questions regarding parent/child relationships and the stigma that goes with any drug use. I found the Jia Hongsheng story interesting. On a down note, the story is in Beijing and some of the fashion and music reek of early 90s even though this was made in 2001, so it's really cheesy sometimes (the Beatles crap, etc). Whatever, not a top ten or twenty but if it's on the television, check it out.",1,felt film mani good qualiti cinematographi certainli differ expos stage aspect set stori origin charact actor certainli achiev felt play quit convincingli cours play definit uniqu cultur aspect may leav mani disappoint familiar chines orient cultur answer lot question regard parent child relationship stigma goe drug use found jia hongsheng stori interest note stori beij fashion music reek earli even though made realli cheesi sometim beatl crap etc whatev not top ten twenti televis check
"This movie is amazing because the fact that the real people portray themselves and their real life experience and do such a good job it's like they're almost living the past over again. Jia Hongsheng plays himself an actor who quit everything except music and drugs struggling with depression and searching for the meaning of life while being angry at everyone especially the people who care for him most. There's moments in the movie that will make you wanna cry because the family especially the father did such a good job. However, this movie is not for everyone. Many people who suffer from depression will understand Hongsheng's problem and why he does the things he does for example keep himself shut in a dark room or go for walks or bike rides by himself. Others might see the movie as boring because it's just so real that its almost like a documentary. Overall this movie is great and Hongsheng deserved an Oscar for this movie so did his Dad.",1,movi amaz fact real peopl portray real life experi good job like almost live past jia hongsheng play actor quit everyth except music drug struggl depress search mean life angri everyon especi peopl care moment movi make wanna cri famili especi father good job howev movi not everyon mani peopl suffer depress understand hongsheng problem thing exampl keep shut dark room go walk bike ride other might see movi bore real almost like documentari overal movi great hongsheng deserv oscar movi dad
"""Quitting"" may be as much about exiting a pre-ordained identity as about drug withdrawal. As a rural guy coming to Beijing, class and success must have struck this young artist face on as an appeal to separate from his roots and far surpass his peasant parents' acting success. Troubles arise, however, when the new man is too new, when it demands too big a departure from family, history, nature, and personal identity. The ensuing splits, and confusion between the imaginary and the real and the dissonance between the ordinary and the heroic are the stuff of a gut check on the one hand or a complete escape from self on the other. Hongshen slips into the latter and his long and lonely road back to self can be grim.<br /><br />But what an exceptionally convincing particularity, honesty, and sensuousness director Zhang Yang, and his actors, bring to this journey. No clichés, no stereotypes, no rigid gender roles, no requisite sex, romance or violence scenes, no requisite street language and, to boot, no assumed money to float character acts and whims. <br /><br />Hongshen Jia is in his mid-twenties. He's a talented actor, impressionable, vain, idealistic, and perhaps emotionally starved. The perfect recipe for his enablers. Soon he's the ""cool"" actor, idolized by youth. ""He was hot in the early nineties."" ""He always had to be the most fashionable."" He needs extremes, and goes in for heavy metal, adopts earrings and a scarf. His acting means the arts, friends--and roles, But not the kind that offer any personal challenge or input. And his self-criticism, dulled by the immediacy of success, opens the doors to an irrational self-doubt, self-hatred-- ""I didn't know how to act"" ""I felt like a phony""--and to readily available drugs to counter them. He says ""I had to get high to do what director wanted."" So, his shallow identity as an actor becomes, via drugs, an escape from identity. <br /><br />Hongshen's disengagement from drugs and his false life is very gradual, intermittent--and doggedly his own. Solitude, space, meditative thinking, speech refusal, replace therapy. The abstract is out. And a great deal of his change occurs outdoors---not in idealized locations but mainly on green patches under the freeways, bridges, and high-rises of Beijing. The physicality is almost romantic, but is not. The bike rides to Ritan Park, the long spontaneous walks, the drenching sun and rain, grassy picnics, the sky patterns and kites that absorb his musing are very specific. He drifts in order to arrive, all the while picking up cues to a more real and realistic identity. ""I started to open up"" he says of this period in retrospect. And the contact seems to start with his lanky body which projects a kind of dancer's positioning (clumsy, graceful, humorous, telling) in a current circumstance. If mind or spirit is lacking, his legs can compel him to walk all night. <br /><br />Central to his comeback is the rejection of set roles. To punctuate his end to acting and his determination to a new identity, he smashes his videos and TV, and bangs his head till bloody against his ""John Lennon Forever"" poster. He has let down his iconic anti-establishment artist---but he's the only viable guide he knows. He even imagines himself as John's son (Yoko Ono), and adopts his ""Mother Mary"" as an intercessor in his ""hour of darkness"" and ""time of trouble."" (the wrenching, shaking pain in the park--hallucinatory and skitzoid ordeals) ""Music is so much more real than acting"" he says. And speaks of Lennon's influence as ""showing me a new way."" In the mental institute, the life-saving apples (resistance, nourishment) reflect Lennon's presence, as does Hongshen's need to re-hang his hero's poster in his redecorated room.<br /><br />If Lennon's influence is spiriting, Hongshen's father's influence is grounding. Although father and son are both actors and users (drugs and drink), it is Fegsen's differences from his son that underwrites his change. For the father is more secure in himself: he accepts that he's Chinese, a peasant in a line of peasants, a rural theater director. And he exercises control over both his habit and his emotions. It's this recognizable identity that drives Hongshen to treat him like a sounding board, sometimes with anger and rage, sometimes with humor (the blue jeans, Beatles) and passivity. In his most crazed, and violent exchange with his father in which he accuses him of being a liar, and a fake, he exposes more of himself than his father: ""all the acts I acted before were bullshit... life is bullshit."" And to Hongshen's emphatic ""you are NOT my father,"" he softly replies, ""why can't a peasant be your father?"" <br /><br />Under these two teachers and with much additional help from his mother, sister, friends, inmates at the rehab inst., he makes some tangible connection to a real (not whole) self. As the long term drug effects recede, so does his old identity. Indebtedness replaces pride, trust distrust. Integrity banishes his black cloud. All his edges soften. ""You are just a human being"" he repeats endlessly after being released from the strap-down incurred for refusing medicine. Back home, lard peasant soap is fine with him now. And his once ""rare and true friendships"" begin again as is so evident in the back to poignant back-to-back fence scene with his musician buddy. Hongshen says of this movie: ""it's a good chance to think about my life."" And I might add, become a New Actor, one bound to art and life. Like Lennon, he has gained success without a loss of identity.",1,quit may much exit pre ordain ident drug withdraw rural guy come beij class success must struck young artist face appeal separ root far surpass peasant parent act success troubl aris howev new man new demand big departur famili histori natur person ident ensu split confus imaginari real disson ordinari heroic stuff gut check one hand complet escap self hongshen slip latter long lone road back self grim except convinc particular honesti sensuous director zhang yang actor bring journey no clich no stereotyp no rigid gender role no requisit sex romanc violenc scene no requisit street languag boot no assum money float charact act whim hongshen jia mid twenti talent actor impression vain idealist perhap emot starv perfect recip enabl soon cool actor idol youth hot earli nineti alway fashion need extrem goe heavi metal adopt ear scarf act mean art friend role not kind offer person challeng input self critic dull immediaci success open door irrat self doubt self hatr know act felt like phoni readili avail drug counter say get high director want shallow ident actor becom via drug escap ident hongshen disengag drug fals life gradual intermitt doggedli solitud space medit think speech refus replac therapi abstract great deal chang occur outdoor not ideal locat mainli green patch freeway bridg high rise beij physic almost romant not bike ride ritan park long spontan walk drench sun rain grassi picnic sky pattern kite absorb muse specif drift order arriv pick cue real realist ident start open say period retrospect contact seem start lanki bodi project kind dancer posit clumsi grace humor tell current circumst mind spirit lack leg compel walk night central comeback reject set role punctuat end act determin new ident smash video tv bang head till bloodi john lennon forev poster let icon anti establish artist viabl guid know even imagin john son yoko ono adopt mother mari intercessor hour dark time troubl wrench shake pain park hallucinatori skitzoid ordeal music much real act say speak lennon influenc show new way mental institut life save appl resist nourish reflect lennon presenc hongshen need hang hero poster redecor room lennon influenc spirit hongshen father influenc ground although father son actor user drug drink fegsen differ son underwrit chang father secur accept chines peasant line peasant rural theater director exercis control habit emot recogniz ident drive hongshen treat like sound board sometim anger rage sometim humor blue jean beatl passiv craze violent exchang father accus liar fake expos father act act bullshit life bullshit hongshen emphat not father softli repli peasant father two teacher much addit help mother sister friend inmat rehab inst make tangibl connect real not whole self long term drug effect reced old ident indebted replac pride trust distrust integr banish black cloud edg soften human repeat endlessli releas strap incur refus medicin back home lard peasant soap fine rare true friendship begin evid back poignant back back fenc scene musician buddi hongshen say movi good chanc think life might add becom new actor one bound art life like lennon gain success without loss ident

"I first saw this movie on IFC. Which is a great network by the way to see underground films. I watched this movie and was thinking it was going to be pure drama and a story line that doesn't hold water. But it really was a worth while watch. The main character is in such rough shape, and you hate to see him deny help, but no matter what you just can't hate him. His devotion to The Beatles and John Lennon is a great metaphor for his life and the helplessness he feels. <br /><br />The atmosphere of the film is also great. At times, you feel like you can see what he sees, feel what he feels in some situations. This movie does not leave you wanting to know more, or disliking a loophole in the plot. There are NO loopholes (in my opinion). I have always been a fan of foreign films, especially now with movies being made so poorly in America. I really enjoy the foreign settings because I feel it can take you on a trip, and sometimes understand a different culture. This movie did all those things to me and more.

"I must say, every time I see this movie, I am deeply touched, not only by the most painful four years of Hongsheng's life, but also by how his family deals with his drug addiction. It is also true that getting addicted to anything, such as drugs, alcohol, or pornography, cannot only hurt you, but also hurt your most important people in the world: your family. Since family is the #1 priority in the Asian culture, it takes guts for the circle to gather together and show one person how much the family loves him/her. this is actually the first Chinese movie that I actually enjoy, not for the fun of it, but the elements surrounding it (superb acting, touching story, great direction) make this movie worth watching. What stands out the most is that Hongsheng and his family act out the story themselves instead of having some B-movie actor trying to imitate the real person.

"I saw this film at the Rotterdam International Film Festival 2002. This seemed to be one of the less popular films on the festival, however, as it turned out, all the more interesting.<br /><br />The story, of an actor trying to come to grips with himself and his environment after withdrawing from a drug addiction, is based on actual facts. Moreover, the characters playing in the film are the real people living this experience over again, this time for the film, which is partly set up as a stage play. Not only do they all happen to be good actors, Jia Hongsheng's parents are actors in real life as well, the methods used in highlighting their relationship towards Jia are very effective.<br /><br />Jia Hongsheng is the actor of some Chinese action films late eighties start nineties. Later you can see him in great films such as Frozen and Suzhou River. In between these two career paths Jia becomes a drug addict and looses all drive to act or even do anything productive, except for making somewhat futile attempts at becoming a guitar virtuoso.<br /><br />I like the way the writer of the scenario choose to emphasize on his behavior after withdrawal more than on the horror of drugs. We really feel the pain and struggle Jia is in. At the same time we hate him for the way he treats those around him.<br /><br />The film draws the viewer into a tiring pattern Jia seems to be caught in, dragging with him his parents and sister who try to take care of him.

"""Night of the Hunted"" stars French porn star Brigitte Lahaie.In fact,many of the cast members in this slow-moving production were porn actors at the time of its frantic filming.This film is certainly different than Rollin's usual lesbian vampire flicks,but it's not as memorable as for example ""Lips of Blood"" or ""Fascination"".Lahaie plays an amnesiac hitchhiker who can't remember who she is or where she came from.Most of the film takes place in a modern apartment complex,where Lahaie is being held by some kind of medical group that's treating a number of people with a similar condition.Anyway,she escapes from the monolithic office tower where the affected people are held.On a highway outside of town,she meets a young man,who stops and picks her up.""Night of the Hunted"" offers plenty of nudity,unfortunately the pace is extremely slow.The atmosphere is horribly sad and the relationship between Brigitte Lahaie and another asylum inmate Dominique Journet is well-developed.Still ""Night of the Hunted"" is too dull to be completely enjoyable.Give it a look only if you are a fan of Jean Rollin's works.7 out of 10 and that's being kind.",1,night hunt star french porn star brigitt lahai fact mani cast member slow move product porn actor time frantic film film certainli differ rollin usual lesbian vampir flick not memor exampl lip blood fascin lahai play amnesiac hitchhik rememb came film take place modern apart complex lahai held kind medic group treat number peopl similar condit anyway escap monolith offic tower affect peopl held highway outsid town meet young man stop pick night hunt offer plenti nuditi unfortun pace extrem slow atmospher horribl sad relationship brigitt lahai anoth asylum inmat dominiqu journet well develop still night hunt dull complet enjoy give look fan jean rollin work kind
"Even if you're a fan of Jean Rollin's idiosyncratic body of work, you will be caught off guard by this exceptional foray into science fiction territory. For once, there's not a single diaphanously gowned vampire girl in sight ! True to tradition, the budget proved way too tight to realize the director's vision entirely. Yet this is largely compensated by his obvious love of genre cinema, dedication to his craft and sheer ingenuity. Jean-Claude Couty's atmospheric cinematography makes the most of the foreboding locations and Philippe Bréjean (a/k/a ""Gary Sandeur"") contributes a startling soundtrack that fortunately doesn't resemble any of the sappy stuff he composed for hardcore.<br /><br />Shot in and around a Paris office block before and after working hours, the film was largely cast with porn regulars Rollin was already quite familiar with from his ""Michel Gentil"" cash-gathering XXX efforts, most notably French f*ck film royalty Brigitte Lahaie in the demanding lead. Playing Elisabeth (rather well, I might add), she's picked up wandering a nearby highway one night by Robert (Vincent Gardère), driving home at the end of a long work day. Barely able to piece together the string of events that got her there, Elisabeth seems to lose her memories mere moments after events occur, even forgetting Robert's name and heroic savior role before their night flight comes to an end at his apartment. Prior to making love, she rightfully describes herself as a virgin (further credit to Brigitte's thespian skills that she can handle the line so convincingly, being after all one of the more active adult actresses of the '70s) because she cannot recall a single touch preceding his. Because of this nifty bit of context, the relatively long sex scene that follows totally eschews the gratuity of other ""commercial"" interludes Rollin has had to include in other works to assure funding.<br /><br />When Robert leaves for work, he's inevitably erased from Elisabeth's feeble mind. A mysterious doctor (comedian Bernard Papineau effectively cast against type) and his menacing assistant Solange (striking porn starlet Rachel Mhas) move in on her during her protector's absence and take her back to the place she turns out to have escaped from. Here we get one of the movie's strongest scenes as she's re-introduced to her roommate Catherine (the late Cathérine Greiner a/k/a hardcore performer ""Cathy Stewart"" in a quietly devastating turn), both girls desperately supplying fictitious shared ""memories"" for one another in a bid to outrun their inevitable fate. That deterioration is not solely limited to the mind becomes painfully clear when they are served lunch and Catherine's unable to control her movements in trying to eat a spoonful of soup. It's also Catherine who gets to voice the filmmaker's compromise with the demands of commerce as she urges Elisabeth to get naked and hold her because sex is all they have left now that both mind and physical faculties have deserted them.<br /><br />Several rather explicit - if not quite hardcore - sex scenes make up the movie's mid-section and French porn aficionados should recognize the likes of Alain Plumey (a/k/a ""Cyril Val""), Jacques Gateau and Elodie Delage, along with a blink and miss bit from future porno princess Marilyn Jess whose rape at the hands, mouth and member of Plumey was only present in the film's rarely screened XXX version FILLES TRAQUEES. The pivotal part of Véronique, a girl Elisabeth almost seems to remember and whom she seeks to escape anew with, is beautifully handled by the exquisite Dominique Journet - in her unforgettable debut - who would go on to play a sizable supporting role in Franco Zeffirelli's LA TRAVIATA. The six feet under ending reveals the deteriorating condition to be the result of a nuclear spill, the quarantined ""patients"" ultimately leaving a barely breathing empty shell, unceremoniously disposed off in a fiery furnace. The final shot offers a particularly heartbreaking variation on that of Chaplin's MODERN TIMES as Elisabeth, approaching complete meltdown by now, and a wounded Robert stumble along the railroad bridge, clumsily clasping each other's outstretched hands.",1,even fan jean rollin idiosyncrat bodi work caught guard except foray scienc fiction territori not singl diaphan gown vampir girl sight true tradit budget prove way tight realiz director vision entir yet larg compens obviou love genr cinema dedic craft sheer ingenu jean claud couti atmospher cinematographi make forebod locat philipp br jean k gari sandeur contribut startl soundtrack fortun resembl sappi stuff compos hardcor shot around pari offic block work hour film larg cast porn regular rollin alreadi quit familiar michel gentil cash gather xxx effort notabl french f ck film royalti brigitt lahai demand lead play elisabeth rather well might add pick wander nearbi highway one night robert vincent gard drive home end long work day bare abl piec togeth string event got elisabeth seem lose memori mere moment event occur even forget robert name heroic savior role night flight come end apart prior make love right describ virgin credit brigitt thespian skill handl line convincingli one activ adult actress cannot recal singl touch preced nifti bit context rel long sex scene follow total eschew gratuiti commerci interlud rollin includ work assur fund robert leav work inevit eras elisabeth feebl mind mysteri doctor comedian bernard papineau effect cast type menac assist solang strike porn starlet rachel mha move protector absenc take back place turn escap get one movi strongest scene introduc roommat catherin late cath rine greiner k hardcor perform cathi stewart quietli devast turn girl desper suppli fictiti share memori one anoth bid outrun inevit fate deterior not sole limit mind becom pain clear serv lunch catherin unabl control movement tri eat spoon soup also catherin get voic filmmak compromis demand commerc urg elisabeth get nake hold sex left mind physic faculti desert sever rather explicit not quit hardcor sex scene make movi mid section french porn aficionado recogn like alain plumey k cyril val jacqu gateau elodi delag along blink miss bit futur porno princess marilyn jess whose rape hand mouth member plumey present film rare screen xxx version fill traque pivot part v roniqu girl elisabeth almost seem rememb seek escap anew beauti handl exquisit dominiqu journet unforgett debut would go play sizabl support role franco zeffirelli la traviata six feet end reveal deterior condit result nuclear spill quarantin patient ultim leav bare breath empti shell unceremoni dispos fieri furnac final shot offer particularli heartbreak variat chaplin modern time elisabeth approach complet meltdown wound robert stumbl along railroad bridg clumsili clasp outstretch hand
"I was surprised how much I enjoyed this. Sure it is a bit slow moving in parts, but what else would one expect from Rollin? Also there is plenty of nudity, nothing wrong with that, particularly as it includes lots of the gorgeous, Brigitte Lahaie. There are also some spectacularly eroticised female dead, bit more dodgey, perhaps, but most effective. There is also a sci-fi like storyline with a brief explanation at the end, but I wouldn't bother too much with that. No, here we have a most interesting exploration of memory and the effect of memory loss and to just what extent one is still 'alive' without memory. My DVD sleeve mentions David Cronenberg and whilst this is perhaps not quite as good as his best films, there is some similarity here, particularly with the great use of seemingly menacing architecture and the effective and creepy use of inside space. As I have tried to indicate this is by no means a rip roaring thriller, it is a captivating, nightmare like movie that makes the very most of its locations, including a stunning railway setting at the end.",1,surpris much enjoy sure bit slow move part els would one expect rollin also plenti nuditi noth wrong particularli includ lot gorgeou brigitt lahai also spectacularli eroticis femal dead bit dodgey perhap effect also sci fi like storylin brief explan end bother much no interest explor memori effect memori loss extent one still aliv without memori dvd sleev mention david cronenberg whilst perhap not quit good best film similar particularli great use seemingli menac architectur effect creepi use insid space tri indic no mean rip roar thriller captiv nightmar like movi make locat includ stun railway set end
"I went into ""Night of the Hunted"" not knowing what to expect at all. I was really impressed.<br /><br />It is essentially a mystery/thriller where this girl who can't remember anything gets 'rescued' by a guy who happens to be driving past. The two become fast friends and lovers and together, they try to figure out what is going on with her. Through some vague flashbacks and grim memories, they eventually get to the bottom of it and the ending is pretty cool.<br /><br />I really liked the setting of this one: a desolate, post-modern Paris is the backdrop with lots of gray skies and tall buildings. Very metropolitan. Groovy soundtrack and lots of nudity.<br /><br />Surprising it was made in 1980; seems somewhat ahead of it's time.<br /><br />8 out of 10, kids.",1,went night hunt not know expect realli impress essenti mysteri thriller girl rememb anyth get rescu guy happen drive past two becom fast friend lover togeth tri figur go vagu flashback grim memori eventu get bottom end pretti cool realli like set one desol post modern pari backdrop lot gray sky tall build metropolitan groovi soundtrack lot nuditi surpris made seem somewhat ahead time kid
"I have certainly not seen all of Jean Rollin's films, but they mostly seem to be bloody vampire naked women fests, which if you like that sort of thing is not bad, but this is a major departure and could almost be Cronenberg minus the bio-mechanical nightmarish stuff. Except it's in French with subtitles of course. A man driving on the road at night comes across a woman that is in her slippers and bathrobe and picks her up, while in the background yet another woman lingers, wearing nothing. As they drive along it's obvious that there is something not right about the woman, in that she forgets things almost as quickly as they happen. Still though, that doesn't prevent the man from having sex with her once they return to Paris & his apartment. The man leaves for work and some strangers show up at his place and take the woman away to this 'tower block', a huge apartment building referred to as the Black Tower, where others of her kind (for whom the 'no memory' things seems to be the least of their problems) are being held for some reason. Time and events march by in the movie, which involve mostly trying to find what's going on and get out of the building for this woman, and she does manage to call Robert, the guy that picked her up in the first place, to come rescue her. The revelation as to what's going on comes in the last few moments of the movie, which has a rather strange yet touching end to it. In avoiding what seemed to be his ""typical"" formula, Rollin created, in this, what I feel is his most fascinating and disturbing film. I like this one a lot, check it out. 8 out of 10.",1,certainli not seen jean rollin film mostli seem bloodi vampir nake women fest like sort thing not bad major departur could almost cronenberg minu bio mechan nightmarish stuff except french subtitl cours man drive road night come across woman slipper bathrob pick background yet anoth woman linger wear noth drive along obviou someth not right woman forget thing almost quickli happen still though prevent man sex return pari apart man leav work stranger show place take woman away tower block huge apart build refer black tower other kind no memori thing seem least problem held reason time event march movi involv mostli tri find go get build woman manag call robert guy pick first place come rescu revel go come last moment movi rather strang yet touch end avoid seem typic formula rollin creat feel fascin disturb film like one lot check

However, Felix's owner wants to take the money and go alone, so Felix figures out a way to sneak along.<br /><br />Once there, Felix barges into a studio and makes a bit of a nuisance of himself.

"Despite the title and unlike some other stories about love and war, this film isn't too sticky and pink, because love is as a rose: With thorns, that is. The four leading actors set their characters realistic and with a good sense and balance between the tragic and the down-to-earth. <br /><br />The music and lyrics of the cabaret/chanson-esquire songs (sung b Keira Knightley herself) drag the viewer deeper and deeper in the film, from one place to another, between the brutal war and amongst the peaceful love. Some people may find it too much a biopic, but it ís mostly a romantic story, even though it consequently follows the life of Dylan Thomas and the triangular relationship which is steeped by joy and jealousy. <br /><br />London gets visualized from another angle for once, the bohemian life of Dylan during the bombings of the Germans is set in a floating atmosphere of small bedrooms, pubs and bars. The independent women, the soldier and the charismatic poet are constantly swept in both feelings of love and anger. <br /><br />Maybe the end is too twisted and hangs somewhat loosely to the rest of the film, but all in all this is a great romantic story.",1,despit titl unlik stori love war film sticki pink love rose thorn four lead actor set charact realist good sens balanc tragic earth music lyric cabaret chanson esquir song sung b keira knightley drag viewer deeper deeper film one place anoth brutal war amongst peac love peopl may find much biopic mostli romant stori even though consequ follow life dylan thoma triangular relationship steep joy jealousi london get visual anoth angl bohemian life dylan bomb german set float atmospher small bedroom pub bar independ women soldier charismat poet constantli swept feel love anger mayb end twist hang somewhat loos rest film great romant stori

"This short is one of the best of all time and is proof (just like most of Charlie Chaplin's work) that sound and color are not requirements for quality work. In fact, this cartoon uses (and may have started) some of the gags and devices that became standard in animation in later years, like caricatures of celebrities (including the afore-mentioned Chaplin. While the characters are silent, they do ""speak"", by use of word balloons, just like in the comics. Given that Felix started out in newspapers as a comic strip, this device is a natural. The atmosphere and style of the short is completely harmonious with that of the comic strip while adding another dimension (literally and figuratively) and makes this short a delight to watch.

"Felix is watching an actor rehearse his lines: ""A ham, A ham! My kingdom for a ham sandwich!!!"" The dramatic guy that tells Felix he'll ""have to sacrifice my art and go into the movies."" He's in tears. Felix just looks at him like he's nuts, and shrugs his shoulders. The old guy tells Felix to ""go ye forth"" and find money to finance a trip to Hollywood. Felix thinks, ""How does he expect me to get the money?""<br /><br />In minutes, of course (this is a cartoon), he spots a shoe business owner putting up a ""bankrupt"" sale on his store.

"Errol Flynn's roguish charm really shines through in this entertaining and exciting, but historically bankrupt biopic of the famous (and some would say infamous) General Custer, that follows his career from his first day at West Point, through the Civil War and out west to the battle at The Little Big Horn, all the while butting heads with rival Arthur Kennedy and romancing pretty Olivia de Havilland.<br /><br />Some might say that Flynn, who delivers a great, flamboyant performance as the general, is basically playing himself playing Custer!<br /><br />A lavish production (that should have been in Technicolor) well directed by Raoul Walsh, They Died With Their Boots On features some truly well-staged battle sequences.

"Warner Brothers tampered considerably with American history in ""Big Trail"" director Raoul Walsh's first-rate western ""They Died with Their Boots On,"" a somewhat inaccurate but wholly exhilarating biography of cavalry officer George Armstrong Custer. The film chronicles Custer from the moment that he arrives at West Point Academy until the Indians massacre him at the Little Big Horn. This is one of Errol Flynn's signature roles and one of Raoul Walsh's greatest epics. Walsh and Flynn teamed in quite often afterward, and ""They Died with Their Boots On"" reunited Olivia de Havilland as Flynn's romantic interest for the last time. They appeared as a couple in seven previous films. This 140-minute, black & white oater is nothing short of brilliant with dynamic action sequences, humorous romantic scenes, and stern dramatic confrontations between our hero and his adversaries. One of the notorious errors involves Colonel Philip Sheridan who is shown as the commandant at West Point before the Civil War. Indeed, Sheridan was a lieutenant at this point. In fact, the commandant was Robert E. Lee as the earlier Flynn film ""Santa Fe Trail"" showed. Another historical lapse concerns Lieutenant General Whitfield Scott; Scott was not the commander of Union troops throughout the Civil War. Warner Brothers presented Custer as a drinker (probably because Flynn had a reputation for drinking), but in real life Custer neither drank nor smoked. Nevertheless, these as well as other historical goofs do not detract from a truly splendid film.<br /><br />""They Died with Their Boots On"" opens with Custer riding into West Point Military Academy arrayed in a fancy dress uniform with an African-American carrying his luggage and tending his dogs. After the sergeant of the guard realizes that he has turned out a honor guard for a future plebe instead of a high-ranking foreign general, the sergeant turns Custer over to a ranking cadet Ned Sharp (Arthur Kennedy of ""City for Conquest"") to take charge of him. Sharp plays a practical job on Custer by installing him in the quarters of Major Romulus Taipe (Stanley Ridges of ""Task Force"") who promptly runs Custer out. Naturally, the volatile Custer attacks Sharp in a public brawl. General Phil Sheridan (John Litel of ""The Sons of Katie Elder"") is prepared to dismiss Custer from West Point for conduct unbecoming. As it turns out, Sheridan cannot expel Custer because Custer has not enrolled. Once he enrolls, Custer establishes a mediocre academic reputation with alacrity to fight and accumulate demerits galore. When the American Civil War erupts, West Point graduates cadets who have not completed their education and rushes them into combat. One of the last cadets hustled off to war is Custer. Avid as he is to get into the fight, Custer encounters his future wife, Elizabeth 'Libby' Bacon (Olivia de Havilland of ""Santa Fe Trail""), and they pledge themselves to each other, despite Mr. Bacon (Gene Lockhart of ""Carousel"") who detests the sight of Custer. It seems that Bacon ran across Custer at a saloon and insulted one of Custer's friends and our hero reprimanded Bacon.<br /><br />Meanwhile, back in Washington, Custer desperately seeks a transfer to a regiment, but Major Taipe has him cooling his heels. Custer befriends rotund Lieutenant General Winfield Scott (Sidney Greenstreet of ""The Maltese Falcon"") and they share an appetite for creamed Bermuda onions that becomes one of Custer's characteristics. Not only does Scott see to it that Taipe assigns Custer to the Second Cavalry, but also Custer appropriates Taipe's horse to get to his command. During the Battle of Bull Run, 21 July 1861, Custer disobeys orders from none other than Sharp, strikes his superior officer and holds a bridge so the infantry can cross it. Wounded in the shoulder and sent to the hospital, Custer receives a medal rather than a court-martial. When Confederate General Jeb Stuart threatens the Union Army at the Battle of Gettysburg, in Pennsylvania, Scott is shocked by the chance that the South may triumph. When a brigadier general cannot be found, Scott goads Taipe into promoting the first available officer. A mistake is made and Custer is promoted. Incredulous at first, Custer embraces the moment and cracks Stuart's advance. After the war, Custer idles down and starts boozing it up with the boys at the local saloons. Sharp shows up as a crooked railroad promoter and with his father they try to enlist Custer to serve as the president of their railway so that they can obtain funds. Eventually, Libby intercedes on his behalf with General Sheridan, who was in command of the army, and gets him back on active duty as the commander of the 7th Cavalry. When he takes command, Custer finds the 7th cavalry a drunken lot and is not surprised that Sharp commands the liquor at the fort. Meanwhile, Custer has his first run in with Crazy Horse (Anthony Quinn of ""The Guns of Navarone"") and takes him into custody. Of course, Crazy Horse escapes, becomes Custer's adversary, and they fight.<br /><br />Once Custer has quelled Crazy Horse and the Indians, Sharp with Taipe as a government agent conspire to destroy a peace treaty with the Sioux and other Indian nations. They also see to it that Custer is brought up on charges for striking Taipe in a saloon brawl. On his way to Washington, Custer discovers the perfidy of Sharp and Taipe who have drummed up a gold strike in the sacred Black Hills. Settlers rampage in and the Indians hit the warpath. Custer sacrifices himself and his 600 men at the Little Big Horn in a slam-bang showdown against 6000 redskins. ""Stagecoach"" lenser Bert Glennon captures both the grit and the glory. The long shot of the 7th Cavalry leaving the fort at dawn is spectacular. As an added premonition of Custer's imminent demise, Libby faints after he leaves their quarters for the Little Big Horn. ""They Died with Their Boots On"" benefits from a top-notch Max Steiner score that incorporates the regimental tune ""Gary Owen.""",1,warner brother tamper consider american histori big trail director raoul walsh first rate western die boot somewhat inaccur wholli exhilar biographi cavalri offic georg armstrong custer film chronicl custer moment arriv west point academi indian massacr littl big horn one errol flynn signatur role one raoul walsh greatest epic walsh flynn team quit often afterward die boot reunit olivia de havilland flynn romant interest last time appear coupl seven previou film minut black white oater noth short brilliant dynam action sequenc humor romant scene stern dramat confront hero adversari one notori error involv colonel philip sheridan shown command west point civil war inde sheridan lieuten point fact command robert e lee earlier flynn film santa fe trail show anoth histor laps concern lieuten gener whitfield scott scott not command union troop throughout civil war warner brother present custer drinker probabl flynn reput drink real life custer neither drank nor smoke nevertheless well histor goof not detract truli splendid film die boot open custer ride west point militari academi array fanci dress uniform african american carri luggag tend dog sergeant guard realiz turn honor guard futur plebe instead high rank foreign gener sergeant turn custer rank cadet ned sharp arthur kennedi citi conquest take charg sharp play practic job custer instal quarter major romulu taip stanley ridg task forc promptli run custer natur volatil custer attack sharp public brawl gener phil sheridan john litel son kati elder prepar dismiss custer west point conduct unbecom turn sheridan cannot expel custer custer not enrol enrol custer establish mediocr academ reput alacr fight accumul demerit galor american civil war erupt west point graduat cadet not complet educ rush combat one last cadet hustl war custer avid get fight custer encount futur wife elizabeth libbi bacon olivia de havilland santa fe trail pledg despit mr bacon gene lockhart carousel detest sight custer seem bacon ran across custer saloon insult one custer friend hero reprimand bacon meanwhil back washington custer desper seek transfer regiment major taip cool heel custer befriend rotund lieuten gener winfield scott sidney greenstreet maltes falcon share appetit cream bermuda onion becom one custer characterist not scott see taip assign custer second cavalri also custer appropri taip hors get command battl bull run juli custer disobey order none sharp strike superior offic hold bridg infantri cross wound shoulder sent hospit custer receiv medal rather court martial confeder gener jeb stuart threaten union armi battl gettysburg pennsylvania scott shock chanc south may triumph brigadi gener cannot found scott goad taip promot first avail offic mistak made custer promot incredul first custer embrac moment crack stuart advanc war custer idl start booz boy local saloon sharp show crook railroad promot father tri enlist custer serv presid railway obtain fund eventu libbi interced behalf gener sheridan command armi get back activ duti command th cavalri take command custer find th cavalri drunken lot not surpris sharp command liquor fort meanwhil custer first run crazi hors anthoni quinn gun navaron take custodi cours crazi hors escap becom custer adversari fight custer quell crazi hors indian sharp taip govern agent conspir destroy peac treati sioux indian nation also see custer brought charg strike taip saloon brawl way washington custer discov perfidi sharp taip drum gold strike sacr black hill settler rampag indian hit warpath custer sacrific men littl big horn slam bang showdown redskin stagecoach lenser bert glennon captur grit glori long shot th cavalri leav fort dawn spectacular ad premonit custer immin demis libbi faint leav quarter littl big horn die boot benefit top notch max steiner score incorpor regiment tune gari owen
"If you keep rigid historical perspective out of it, this film is actually quite entertaining. It's got action, adventure and romance, and one of the premiere casting match-ups of the era with Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland in the lead roles. As evident on this board, the picture doesn't pass muster with purists who look for one hundred percent accuracy in their story telling. To get beyond that, one need only put aside the history book, and enjoy the story as if it were a work of fiction. I know, I know, that's hard to do when you consider Custer's Last Stand at the Little Big Horn and it's prominence in the history of post Civil War America. So I guess there's an unresolved quandary with the picture, no matter how you look at it.<br /><br />There's a lot to take in here though for the picture's two hour plus run time. Custer's arrival at West Point is probably the first head scratcher, riding up as he does in full military regalia. The practical joke by Sharp (Arthur Kennedy) putting him up in the Major's headquarters probably should have gotten them both in trouble.<br /><br />Ironically, a lot of scenes in this military film play for comedy, as in Custer's first meeting with Libby Bacon, and subsequent encounters that include tea reader Callie (Hattie McDaniel). I hadn't noticed it before in other films, but McDaniel reminded me an awful lot of another favorite character actor of mine from the Forties, Mantan Moreland. So much so that in one scene it looked like it might have been Moreland hamming it up in a dress. With that in mind, the owl scene was a hoot too.<br /><br />As for Flynn, it's interesting to note that a year earlier, he portrayed J.E.B. Stuart opposite Ronald Reagan's depiction of General Custer in ""Santa Fe Trail"", both vying for the attention of none other than Olivia de Havilland. In that film, Reagan put none of the arrogance and flamboyance into the character of Custer that history remembers, while in Flynn's portrayal here it's more than evident. But it doesn't come close to that of Richard Mulligan's take on the military hero in 1970's ""Little Big Man"". Let's just say that one was a bit over the top.<br /><br />The better take away the picture had for me was the manner in which Custer persevered to maintain his good name and not gamble it away on a risky business venture. That and his loyalty to the men he led in battle along with the discipline he developed over the course of the story. Most poignant was that final confrontation with arch rival Sharp just before riding into the Little Big Horn, in which he declared that hell or glory was entirely dependent on one's point of view. Earlier, a similar remark might have given us the best insight of all into Custer's character, when he stated - ""You take glory with you when it's your time to go"".",1,keep rigid histor perspect film actual quit entertain got action adventur romanc one premier cast match up era errol flynn olivia de havilland lead role evid board pictur pass muster purist look one hundr percent accuraci stori tell get beyond one need put asid histori book enjoy stori work fiction know know hard consid custer last stand littl big horn promin histori post civil war america guess unresolv quandari pictur no matter look lot take though pictur two hour plu run time custer arriv west point probabl first head scratcher ride full militari regalia practic joke sharp arthur kennedi put major headquart probabl gotten troubl iron lot scene militari film play comedi custer first meet libbi bacon subsequ encount includ tea reader calli hatti mcdaniel notic film mcdaniel remind aw lot anoth favorit charact actor mine forti mantan moreland much one scene look like might moreland ham dress mind owl scene hoot flynn interest note year earlier portray j e b stuart opposit ronald reagan depict gener custer santa fe trail vy attent none olivia de havilland film reagan put none arrog flamboy charact custer histori rememb flynn portray evid come close richard mulligan take militari hero littl big man let say one bit top better take away pictur manner custer persev maintain good name not gambl away riski busi ventur loyalti men led battl along disciplin develop cours stori poignant final confront arch rival sharp ride littl big horn declar hell glori entir depend one point view earlier similar remark might given us best insight custer charact state take glori time go
"After working on 7 movies with director Mickael Curtiz (The Adventures of Robin Hood are their best achievement), Errol Flynn got tired of his dictatorial direction and decided to work with the great Raoul Walsh. This reunion is a happy thing for cinematography. THE DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON is their first and best film together. Raoul Walsh portrays the General George Armstrong Custer (Errol Flynn) from his debuts at West Point, to the Civil War and finally at the battle of Little Big Horn. It's true the film shows a too heroic portrait of Custer, but that's not important. What is important, is the fact that we are transported with the passion and glory carried by the characters. Who can forget California Joe, the great ""Queen's Own Buttler"" with his song ""Garryowen"", the touching Mrs Custer (Olivia de Havilland), the diabolic Sharp well played by Arthur Kennedy ?<br /><br />An eternal blow remains on this epic and tragic freso.",1,work movi director mickael curtiz adventur robin hood best achiev errol flynn got tire dictatori direct decid work great raoul walsh reunion happi thing cinematographi die boot first best film togeth raoul walsh portray gener georg armstrong custer errol flynn debut west point civil war final battl littl big horn true film show heroic portrait custer not import import fact transport passion glori carri charact forget california joe great queen buttler song garryowen touch mr custer olivia de havilland diabol sharp well play arthur kennedi etern blow remain epic tragic freso
"I first viewed ""They Died With There Boots On"",about 1970 and though it has been many years since,this film and its impression remain.the cast was good to excellent and the lead man was truly heroic.When I first saw this film I knew the wisest as well as the only real position to have was to enjoy this film as a rousing bit of entertainment and then some.I felt then as I even feel now that the Silver Screen does not as such provide for a true depiction of much of anything let alone The Life of George Armstrong Custer,however the Director Raoul Walsh was to contribute to the real value represented in this film when I watched a semi-documentary with other great directors like Vincent Mennelli wherein these central figures talked about there accomplishments with valuable comments providing a glimpse into the Hollywood mind set.This is what I considered something of interest and where all of this became terribly interesting and very enjoyable.Yet, there have been so much made of all the problems with the silver screen and its story telling ability that some of the enjoyment has been lost and perhaps you would find that to be true here as well.Custer ranked 34 in a graduating class of...34.Much has been made of Custer's final class ranking,but of the 68 cadets who entered the Military Academy with him in 1857,half of them had already flunked out or quit by graduation day,June 24,1861.It is suggested in the movie as the various instructors are determining if a soldier is fit for command and then they come upon the name of George Armstrong Custer and there is to be certain an exchange between the two sides and here is where the Sargeant on Duty says in almost a low tone even to suggest as if that came out by accident""His squadron would follow him to hell,""Your at attention Sargeant,reprimands Tape.If Iam not mistaken when Flynn shows up at a initial battlefield it acknowledged that Custer did not see action right away and indeed he was doing work as a reliable attaché to not only Sheridan,but Hancocks forces as well only to end up for a time with the Army of The Potomac under General George McClellan.There is some truth to the audacity attributed to Custers battlefield heroics as was illustrated when in a counterattack ,""young Custer spurred his horse to the lead and boldly plunged in among the stunned Confederates.As a lone Union Soldier surrounded by rebels,Custers audacity shone through.He accepted the surrender of several enemy soldiers,including a rebel captain.Yet most outstanding was that in this action he personally captured the very first Confederate battle flag taken by the Army of the Potomac.This notable act of courage marked him as an officer of great battlefield promise.""Robert L.Bateman-Armchair General.There is a problem here and that is the telling of the story and the truth as to George Armstrong Custer,the story is good Hollywood entertainment perhaps even great entertainment but for whatever reasons all that could be told was changed for entertainment purposes.Though this maybe jumping the gun it might be well to know that Tom Custer was to lose his life at the ""Little Big Horn"" only a few feet from where George Custer was to die as well.They were brothers and Tom Custer to this very day holds a honorable distinction of being amongst a very small group perhaps only 3 others to have been awarded the Medal of Honor twice in his military career.The list of engagements that the motion picture shows indicate that Custers indeed was an active young officer.He was not with Union forces at either Chancellorsville or for that matter Fredericksburg however he was with them at the Battle of Antietam and at that point in time he was actually promoted to Captain by General McClellan but that was not to last as McClellan was soon to be replaced due to the historical fact that The Army of The Potomac had the means,and the information(discovered wrapped around some cigars was General Lee's plans to split his forces)and yet he failed to act for some 17 hours.It can be speculated that the war could of been over then and there had that occurred but when McClellan failed to act President Lincoln replaced him permanently and the promotion was lost as a result. Custers greatest victory may of in fact come at Gettysburg,Pa.His forces which occupied an area called cemetery ridge at the field at Gettysburg in the summer of 1863 were able to defeat a Jeb Stuart Led Cavalry of some 6,000 rebels with but a force of 2,300.I Think the heroics at Gettysburg by Custer are worth some discussion.There is speculation had in the movie that Custers appointment was a blunder, well you better guess again because not only did Custer have men in his corner but he established a petition to present to the Governor of the State of Michigan which by the way was relatively new to the Union Cause and where preparing to form Cavalry regiments.Though Custer was severely admonished for that kind of shenanigan when he showed up in all that Gold Braid it was not by accident as you would be led to believe.The truth be told Custers defense at Gettysburg prohibited Jeb Stuart from having lunch at the Unions rear stores and vitally protected that flank.This action by the way occurred and it was timed to coincide with Picketts Charge so to make for the greatest likelihood of success.It was a critical victory and Custer was at his bravest and best.His men did follow him to hell and lived to tell about it.",1,first view die boot though mani year sinc film impress remain cast good excel lead man truli heroic first saw film knew wisest well real posit enjoy film rous bit entertain felt even feel silver screen not provid true depict much anyth let alon life georg armstrong custer howev director raoul walsh contribut real valu repres film watch semi documentari great director like vincent mennelli wherein central figur talk accomplish valuabl comment provid glimps hollywood mind set consid someth interest becam terribl interest enjoy yet much made problem silver screen stori tell abil enjoy lost perhap would find true well custer rank graduat class much made custer final class rank cadet enter militari academi half alreadi flunk quit graduat day june suggest movi variou instructor determin soldier fit command come upon name georg armstrong custer certain exchang two side sargeant duti say almost low tone even suggest came accid squadron would follow hell attent sargeant reprimand tape iam not mistaken flynn show initi battlefield acknowledg custer not see action right away inde work reliabl attach not sheridan hancock forc well end time armi potomac gener georg mcclellan truth audac attribut custer battlefield heroic illustr counterattack young custer spur hors lead boldli plung among stun confeder lone union soldier surround rebel custer audac shone accept surrend sever enemi soldier includ rebel captain yet outstand action person captur first confeder battl flag taken armi potomac notabl act courag mark offic great battlefield promis robert l bateman armchair gener problem tell stori truth georg armstrong custer stori good hollywood entertain perhap even great entertain whatev reason could told chang entertain purpos though mayb jump gun might well know tom custer lose life littl big horn feet georg custer die well brother tom custer day hold honor distinct amongst small group perhap other award medal honor twice militari career list engag motion pictur show indic custer inde activ young offic not union forc either chancellorsvil matter fredericksburg howev battl antietam point time actual promot captain gener mcclellan not last mcclellan soon replac due histor fact armi potomac mean inform discov wrap around cigar gener lee plan split forc yet fail act hour specul war could occur mcclellan fail act presid lincoln replac perman promot lost result custer greatest victori may fact come gettysburg pa forc occupi area call cemeteri ridg field gettysburg summer abl defeat jeb stuart led cavalri rebel forc think heroic gettysburg custer worth discuss specul movi custer appoint blunder well better guess not custer men corner establish petit present governor state michigan way rel new union caus prepar form cavalri regiment though custer sever admonish kind shenanigan show gold braid not accid would led believ truth told custer defens gettysburg prohibit jeb stuart lunch union rear store vital protect flank action way occur time coincid pickett charg make greatest likelihood success critic victori custer bravest best men follow hell live tell

"I blame ""Birth of a Nation"" myself - for commencing the long-running tradition of Hollywood travesties of history, of which there can be few greater examples than this. Apart from getting the names of Custer and his 7th Cavalry, Crazy Horse and the Sioux and President Grant spelt right, the geography correct and the fact that Custer and his men were indeed wiped out to a man, the rest just takes hyperbole and invention to ludicrous limits. Throw in some downright hackneyed scenes of the purest exposition, (try Custer and his wife's learning of the phony ""Gold Rush"" to excuse the invasion of the Sioux territory, Custer's testimony in front of Congress pleading the rights of the Red Indians and to top it all, Custer's storming into the president's office to beg to return to his post), honestly there's plenty more of the same, some of these scenes almost comical in their corniness... ...And yet, and yet, it's still a great actioner with Flynn as dashing as ever, DeHavilland as beguiling as ever, the young Anthony Quinn getting a start as Crazy Horse and director Walsh as barnstorming as ever in his depiction of crowd scenes and of course the tumultuous action sequences.

"BEING Warner Brothers' second historical drama featuring Civil War and Battle of the Little Big Horn, General George Armstrong Custer, THEY DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON (Warner Brothers, 1941) was the far more accurate of the two; especially when contrasted with SANTA FE TRAIL (Warner Brothers, 1940), which really didn't set the bar very high.<br /><br />ALTHOUGH both pictures were starring vehicles for Errol Flynn, there was a change in the casting the part of General Custer. Whereas it was ""Dutch"", himself, Ronald Reagan portraying the flamboyant, egomaniacal Cavalryman in the earlier picture, with Mr. Flynn playing Virginian and later Confederate Hero General, J.E.B. (or Jeb) Stuart; Errol took on the Custer part for THEY DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON.<br /><br />ONCE again, the Warner Brothers' propensity for using a large number of reliable character actors from the ""Warner's Repertory Company"" are employed in giving the film a sort of authenticity, and all is really happening right before our very own eyes. Major roles are taken by some better known actors and actresses, such as: Elizabeth Bacon/Mrs. Custer (co-star Olivia de Havilland), Ned Sharpe (Arthur Kennedy), Samuel Bacon (Gene Lockhart), Chief Crazy Horse (Anthony Quinn), ""Californy"" (Charlie Grapwin), Major Taipe (Stanley Ridges), General Phillip Sheridan (John Litel), Callie (the Bacon's Maid, Hattie McDaniel). <br /><br />THE rest of the cast is just chock full of uncredited, though skilled players such as: Joe Sawyer, Eleanor Parker, Minor Watson, Tod Andrews, Irving Bacon, Roy Barcroft, Lane Chandler, Spencer Charters, Frank Ferguson, Francis Ford, William Forrest, George Eldridge, Russell Hicks, William Hopper, Hoppity Hooper, Eddie Keane, Fred Kelsey, Sam McDaniel, Patrick McVey, Frank Orth, Eddie Parker, Addison Richards, Ray Teal, Jim Thorpe (All-American, himself), Minerva Urecal, Dick Wessel, Gig Young and many, many more.<br /><br />THE film moves very quickly, particularly in the early goings; then sort of slows down out of necessity as the story moves along to the Post Civil War years, the assignment of Custer as a Colonel in the 7th Cavalry and the ultimate destiny at the Little Big Horn, in Montana. Under the guidance of Director, Griffith Veteran, Raoul Walsh, the film hits a greatly varied array of emotions; from the very serious, exciting battle scenes and convincing historical scenes; looking as if they were Matthew Brady Civil War Photos. As with most any of Mr. Walsh's films, he punctuates and expedites the end of many a scene with a little humor; but not going overboard and thus risking the chance of turning the film into a comedy (farce, actually).<br /><br />AS previously mentioned, this is much more factual than its predecessor, SANTA FE TRAIL (last time we'll mention it, honest Schultz, Scout's Honor!). However, that is not to say that it wasn't without a few little bits of ""Artistic and Literary License; as indeed, just about any Biopic will have. It would be impossible to make any similar type of film if indeed every fact and incident were to be tried to be included in the screenplay. Perhaps the most erroneous inclusion as well as the most obvious invocation of Literary License is that business about Custer's being accidentally promoted to the rank of Brigadier General. It just didn't happen that way, yet the ""gag"" both helped the film to move along; while it underscored the whole light, carefree feeling that permeated the early part of the film.<br /><br />DIRECTOR Walsh and Mr. Flynn collaborated in giving us what would seem to be a characterization of this legendary Civil War Hero that was very close to the real life man. And they did this on top of the recreation of an incident, being the Massacre by the Lakota Sioux, the Cheyenne and the Fukowi of Custer and his 7th Cavalry at the Little Big Horn. At the time of its occurrence, June 25, 1876, ""Custer's Last Stand"" was as big an incident and shock to the Americans' National Psyche as were the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor (December 7, 1941) or the Atrocities perpetrated by the Islamic Fascists to New York's Twin Trade Towers and the United States' Armed Forces' Headquarters in the Pentagon, Arlington, Virginia on September 11, 2002.<br /><br />JUST as so many films of that period of WORLD WAR II (and the years immediately before), there were so many incidents in it that were, if not intentionally done, were demonstrations of virtues that would be needed in time of another Global Conflict, such as we were in by the time of THEY DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON was finishing up its original Theatrical release period.<br /><br />POODLE SCHNITZ!!",1,warner brother second histor drama featur civil war battl littl big horn gener georg armstrong custer die boot warner brother far accur two especi contrast santa fe trail warner brother realli set bar high although pictur star vehicl errol flynn chang cast part gener custer wherea dutch ronald reagan portray flamboy egomaniac cavalryman earlier pictur mr flynn play virginian later confeder hero gener j e b jeb stuart errol took custer part die boot warner brother propens use larg number reliabl charact actor warner repertori compani employ give film sort authent realli happen right eye major role taken better known actor actress elizabeth bacon mr custer co star olivia de havilland ned sharp arthur kennedi samuel bacon gene lockhart chief crazi hors anthoni quinn californi charli grapwin major taip stanley ridg gener phillip sheridan john litel calli bacon maid hatti mcdaniel rest cast chock full uncredit though skill player joe sawyer eleanor parker minor watson tod andrew irv bacon roy barcroft lane chandler spencer charter frank ferguson franci ford william forrest georg eldridg russel hick william hopper hoppiti hooper eddi kean fred kelsey sam mcdaniel patrick mcvey frank orth eddi parker addison richard ray teal jim thorp american minerva urec dick wessel gig young mani mani film move quickli particularli earli go sort slow necess stori move along post civil war year assign custer colonel th cavalri ultim destini littl big horn montana guidanc director griffith veteran raoul walsh film hit greatli vari array emot seriou excit battl scene convinc histor scene look matthew bradi civil war photo mr walsh film punctuat expedit end mani scene littl humor not go overboard thu risk chanc turn film comedi farc actual previous mention much factual predecessor santa fe trail last time mention honest schultz scout honor howev not say without littl bit artist literari licens inde biopic would imposs make similar type film inde everi fact incid tri includ screenplay perhap erron inclus well obviou invoc literari licens busi custer accident promot rank brigadi gener happen way yet gag help film move along underscor whole light carefre feel permeat earli part film director walsh mr flynn collabor give us would seem character legendari civil war hero close real life man top recreat incid massacr lakota sioux cheyenn fukowi custer th cavalri littl big horn time occurr june custer last stand big incid shock american nation psych japanes attack pearl harbor decemb atroc perpetr islam fascist new york twin trade tower unit state arm forc headquart pentagon arlington virginia septemb mani film period world war ii year immedi mani incid not intent done demonstr virtu would need time anoth global conflict time die boot finish origin theatric releas period poodl schnitz
"When one stops to recollect upon the frequent on screen teaming of Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHavilland, ""They Died With Their Boots On"" (1941) is most likely the film remembered best. It is the sweeping saga of General Custer (Flynn) - told from the time he enters West Point military academy and falls for the luscious Elizabeth Bacon (DeHavilland), through his tenure during the American Civil War, and finally with his death at Little Big Horn. Director, Raoul Walsh mounts his historical epic on the laurels of highly questionable recanting of historical texts, rewritten by screen writers Wally Kline and Aeneas MacKenzie, until truth and fiction are warped all out of proportion. Hence, the battle against Chief Crazy Horse (Anthony Quinn) is portrayed as a crooked deal between politicians - California Joe (Charley Grapewin) and a spuriously absent corporation which wants to reclaim the land Custer gave to the Indians through the systematic genocide of the Nation's first peoples. <br /><br />Flynn, who cleverly plays Custer as though he is one part Arnold Schwartzenegger to two parts Albert Schweitzer, has never been more ignoble. He literally oozes charm and sex appeal from every pore that easily melts the heart of his loyal heroine. Resident Warner stock players, Arthur Kennedy and Sidney Greenstreet deliver marvelous cameos that appear to have far more depth and character than is actually written into the material for them.<br /><br />Overall, then, despite its loose rendering of history in favor of a good romantic yarn, ""They Died With Their Boots On"" is ample film fodder for a Saturday matinée or Sunday night cooing with one's sweetheart. Warner's DVD is pretty nice looking. Although film grain is often obvious, the gray scale has been very nicely rendered with deep, solid blacks and very clean whites.

"The historical inaccuracies of this film have been well documented. It was never intended to be serious history but an entertaining saga and there it succeeds. Errol Flynn was never better as this role was tailored for him. Olivia DeHavilland was never more beautiful. Arthur Kennedy never more villainous. Anthony Quinn never more noble than as Crazy Horse. It had much humor and pathos and held your interest throughout. The one historical aspect I found most glaringly inaccurate was the final ""Last Stand"" which occurred on the banks of the Little Big Horn. The film version was filmed in a desert with no river in sight.

"It's true that ""They Died With Their Boots On"" gives a highly fictionalized account of George Armstrong Custer's (Errol Flynn) life and career, but a remarkable one, especially with regard to the Battle of the Little Big Horn. Because it is not a given that a 1941 movie tries to portray both the US-American cavalryman and Native American leader Chief Crazy Horse (Anthony Quinn) in a favorable light. I'm almost tempted to say that ""Little Big Man"" in its unqualified anti-Custer stance seems unbalanced by comparison. Further, one should not be mislead by the title of the picture  this isn't just a movie about the Battle of the Little Big Horn, it's a movie about that shows the unreliable West Point cadet, the famed Civil War hero, the Indian fighter, and, last but not least, the husband.<br /><br />The movie begins with Custer's time at the West Point military academy, where his recalcitrance and insubordinate behavior lead to frequent demerits. During a punitive military exercise, he meets his future wife, Elizabeth Bacon (Olivia de Havilland), who, like Custer himself, is a native of Monroe, Michigan. Custer intends to court her, but the outbreak of the Civil War calls him away. Custer's legendary bravery is shown in a sequence of battle scenes, the greatest of which is devoted to his engagement with legendary Southern cavalry general Jeb Stuart during the Battle of Gettysburg. While on leave, he travels to Monroe and courts Elizabeth, who promises him her hand in matrimony. Immediately after the war, Custer and Elizabeth Bacon are married.<br /><br />With the Civil War over, Custer is demoted, doesn't get a real command, and has to go through the painstakingly slow process of promotion in the small, professional American army. As he starts to drink, his wife intervenes in his behalf with former general-in-chief Winfield Scott. Custer is given the command of the US 7th Cavalry, which he trains to be an elite unit. Neither Custer nor Crazy Horse are desirous of battle, but greedy businessmen and corrupt politicians decide to build a railroad through Indian lands in clear violation to earlier treaties. Custer explicitly acknowledges the justice of Crazy Horse's cause, but rides into battle to do his duty as a soldier, exposing the conspiracy of the moneyed interests in a letter he writes on the eve of battle.<br /><br />""They Died With Their Boots On,"" though short on historical accuracy, is as good as war movies and Westerns in the 1940s got: Both Custer and Crazy Horse are played by major actors, neither the Indians nor the Southern Confederacy are denigrated, and the courtship scenes with beautiful Livvy de Havilland are just charming. The only minus, and that's why I can't give this picture a full 10, is the undercurrent of racism in the portrayal of African American servants; Elizabeth's servant Callie is the stereotypical, overweight, good-natured, superstitious black mammy.<br /><br />It is also interesting that the movie does not find fault with either Custer or Crazy Horse, but with the greed of the railroad companies pressuring Washington politicians with semi-criminal methods into breaking assurances they had given to the Native Americans. Just a couple of years later, the insinuation that American entrepreneurs could even think of doing anything remotely questionable would probably have been taken as a hint that the film makers were communist sympathizers.<br /><br />Needless to say that ""They Died With Their Boots On"" omits the fact that Custer's overly aggressive tactics often bordered on the foolhardy, greatly overstates the importance of his engagement with Stuart, and doesn't mention the lack of reconnaissance prior to the Battle of the Little Big Horn. Nevertheless, Custer was seen as a war hero by his contemporaries and had some spectacular exploits to point to in the Battles of Brandy Station, Gettysburg, Trevilian Station and others, though his feats of arms were not as decisive for the Civil War as ""They Died With Their Boots On"" suggests.<br /><br />In any event, ""They Died With Their Boots On"" is a well-made war movie with Western elements, three outstanding performers (Flynn, Quinn, and de Havilland), and offers a positive view of Native Americans as well as a negative one on big money, which wouldn't be seen in major Hollywood productions for decades to come. It would deserve a 10 if it weren't for the racist minstrelization of African Americans.",1,true die boot give highli fiction account georg armstrong custer errol flynn life career remark one especi regard battl littl big horn not given movi tri portray us american cavalryman nativ american leader chief crazi hors anthoni quinn favor light almost tempt say littl big man unqualifi anti custer stanc seem unbalanc comparison one not mislead titl pictur movi battl littl big horn movi show unreli west point cadet fame civil war hero indian fighter last not least husband movi begin custer time west point militari academi recalcitr insubordin behavior lead frequent demerit punit militari exercis meet futur wife elizabeth bacon olivia de havilland like custer nativ monro michigan custer intend court outbreak civil war call away custer legendari braveri shown sequenc battl scene greatest devot engag legendari southern cavalri gener jeb stuart battl gettysburg leav travel monro court elizabeth promis hand matrimoni immedi war custer elizabeth bacon marri civil war custer demot get real command go painstakingli slow process promot small profession american armi start drink wife interven behalf former gener chief winfield scott custer given command us th cavalri train elit unit neither custer nor crazi hors desir battl greedi businessmen corrupt politician decid build railroad indian land clear violat earlier treati custer explicitli acknowledg justic crazi hors caus ride battl duti soldier expos conspiraci money interest letter write eve battl die boot though short histor accuraci good war movi western got custer crazi hors play major actor neither indian nor southern confederaci denigr courtship scene beauti livvi de havilland charm minu give pictur full undercurr racism portray african american servant elizabeth servant calli stereotyp overweight good natur superstiti black mammi also interest movi not find fault either custer crazi hors greed railroad compani pressur washington politician semi crimin method break assur given nativ american coupl year later insinu american entrepreneur could even think anyth remot question would probabl taken hint film maker communist sympath needless say die boot omit fact custer overli aggress tactic often border foolhardi greatli overst import engag stuart mention lack reconnaiss prior battl littl big horn nevertheless custer seen war hero contemporari spectacular exploit point battl brandi station gettysburg trevilian station other though feat arm not decis civil war die boot suggest event die boot well made war movi western element three outstand perform flynn quinn de havilland offer posit view nativ american well neg one big money seen major hollywood product decad come would deserv racist minstrel african american
"The film is excellent. One of the most noteworthy things about it is that Flynn's performance is superb. This is worth stressing, as he was often derided as an actor by Bette Davis et al.<br /><br />I remember the scene where Flynn gets Arthur Kennedy drunk in order to take him to his doom at the Battle of the Little Big Horn. The cold, calculating look on Flynn's face as he does so is extraordinary - much better than the much vaunted Spencer Tracy or many other stars could have done.<br /><br />The other thing to note is the excellent performance by George P.

"This movie is good for entertainment purposes, but it is not historically reliable. If you are looking for a movie and thinking to yourself `Oh I want to learn more about Custer's life and his last stand', do not rent `They Died with Their Boots On'. But, if you would like to watch a movie for the enjoyment of an older western film, with a little bit of romance and just for a good story, this is a fun movie to watch.<br /><br />The story starts out with Custer's (Errol Flynn) first day at West Point. Everyone loves his charming personality which allows him to get away with most everything. The movie follows his career from West Point and his many battles, including his battle in the Civil War. The movie ends with his last stand at Little Big Horn. In between the battle scenes, he finds love and marriage with Libby (Olivia De Havilland).<br /><br />Errol Flynn portrays the arrogant, but suave George Armstrong Custer well. Olivia De Havilland plays the cute, sweet Libby very well, especially in the flirting scene that Custer and Libby first meet. Their chemistry on screen made you believe in their romance. The acting in general was impressive, especially the comedic role ( although stereotypical) of Callie played by Hattie McDaniel. Her character will definitely make you laugh.<br /><br />The heroic war music brought out the excitement of the battle scenes. The beautiful costumes set the tone of the era. The script, at times, was corny, although the movie was still enjoyable to watch. The director's portrayal of Custer was as a hero and history shows this is debatable. Some will watch this movie and see Custer as a hero. Others will watch this movie and learn hate him.<br /><br />I give it a thumbs up for this 1942 western film.",1,movi good entertain purpos not histor reliabl look movi think oh want learn custer life last stand not rent die boot would like watch movi enjoy older western film littl bit romanc good stori fun movi watch stori start custer errol flynn first day west point everyon love charm person allow get away everyth movi follow career west point mani battl includ battl civil war movi end last stand littl big horn battl scene find love marriag libbi olivia de havilland errol flynn portray arrog suav georg armstrong custer well olivia de havilland play cute sweet libbi well especi flirt scene custer libbi first meet chemistri screen made believ romanc act gener impress especi comed role although stereotyp calli play hatti mcdaniel charact definit make laugh heroic war music brought excit battl scene beauti costum set tone era script time corni although movi still enjoy watch director portray custer hero histori show debat watch movi see custer hero other watch movi learn hate give thumb western film
"Naturally, along with everyone else, I was primed to expect a lot of Hollywood fantasy revisionism in THEY DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON over the legend of Custer. Just having someone like Errol Flynn play Custer is enough of a clue that the legend has precedence over the truth in this production. And for the most part my expectations were fulfilled (in an admittedly rousing and entertaining way).<br /><br />Yet even in this obviously biased (and much criticized) retelling of the Custer story, I was struck by some of the points made in this movie that, sometimes subtly but nevertheless solidly, seemed to counter the typical clichés of manifest destiny and unvarnished heroism usually found in Westerns of the early 20th century.<br /><br />For instance, even while this film attempted to whitewash it's hero, certain scenes still suggested the more flawed and foolish character of the real-life Custer: <br /><br />1) His initial entrance at the West Point front gate, in which his arrogance and pompousness is a clear aspect of his character.<br /><br />2) His miserable record at West Point, which seems to be attributed as much to Custer's cluelessness about the demands of military service as any other factor; there are moments in the way Flynn plays Custer at West Point where he seems downright stupid.<br /><br />3) Custer's promotion to General is not only presented as a ridiculous mistake, but it plays out as slapstick comedy. I half-expected to see the Marx Brothers or Abbott and Costello wander into the scene.<br /><br />4) Custer's stand against Jeb Stuart at Gettysburg is not whitewashed as brilliant military tactical leadership, but is presented as reckless and wildly lucky.<br /><br />5) Custer's drinking problem is certainly not ignored.<br /><br />And although the music and some of the ways the Indians were shown in this film were certainly reinforcements of the racist stereotype of the ignorant savage, it still came as a surprise to me that the movie actually went into some detail as to why the Indians were justified in attacking the whites who were moving into their land, and fairly explicitly laid the blame for the battles in the Black Hills squarely at the foot of the white man. In fact, no one can argue that the clear villain of the piece is not Anthony Quinn as Sitting Bull, but Arthur Kennedy & Co. as the white devils making the false claim of gold in the Black Hills. Sure, that part of the story is true, but I didn't expect to see it portrayed quite so unequivically in a movie like this.<br /><br />And one other thing: usually in these films it is the Indians who are portrayed en masse as drunken animals seemingly incapable of the basic common sense to avoid getting falling down drunk any time they get near alcohol. In this movie, it is actually the troops of the 7th Cavalry, and not the Indians, who in at least two scenes are portrayed this way.<br /><br />All in all, this movie slips in some surprising moments in the midst of the Hollywood bunk.",1,natur along everyon els prime expect lot hollywood fantasi revision die boot legend custer someon like errol flynn play custer enough clue legend preced truth product part expect fulfil admittedli rous entertain way yet even obvious bias much critic retel custer stori struck point made movi sometim subtli nevertheless solidli seem counter typic clich manifest destini unvarnish heroism usual found western earli th centuri instanc even film attempt whitewash hero certain scene still suggest flaw foolish charact real life custer initi entranc west point front gate arrog pompous clear aspect charact miser record west point seem attribut much custer clueless demand militari servic factor moment way flynn play custer west point seem downright stupid custer promot gener not present ridicul mistak play slapstick comedi half expect see marx brother abbott costello wander scene custer stand jeb stuart gettysburg not whitewash brilliant militari tactic leadership present reckless wildli lucki custer drink problem certainli not ignor although music way indian shown film certainli reinforc racist stereotyp ignor savag still came surpris movi actual went detail indian justifi attack white move land fairli explicitli laid blame battl black hill squar foot white man fact no one argu clear villain piec not anthoni quinn sit bull arthur kennedi co white devil make fals claim gold black hill sure part stori true expect see portray quit unequiv movi like one thing usual film indian portray en mass drunken anim seemingli incap basic common sens avoid get fall drunk time get near alcohol movi actual troop th cavalri not indian least two scene portray way movi slip surpris moment midst hollywood bunk

"Although ""They Died with their Boots On"" is not entirely historically accurate it is a very entertaining western. Not only is Flynn the perfect Custer, the character actors are superb. Besides the action portion of the movie Flynn and DeHavilland's love scenes are very touching and believable.(Flynn and DeHavilland were very fond of each other in real life).

"The saving grace of this film is its humour. Playing up to the strengths of their star, Warner Brothers cast their version of General Custer as a cocky, dashing, irreverent prankster with a romantic streak and an unexpected strain of idealism; it was Robin Hood all over again, and Flynn blossomed in the role. All his best action pictures made use of his talent for mischief and comic timing, and this one was no exception.<br /><br />It also benefits from the return of former co-star Olivia de Havilland, despite an earlier agreement to break the partnership; the part of strong-minded Libby Custer is a better role than the sweet love-interest types she had grown tired of playing for the studio in Flynn's later films, and after seeing the script he had specifically requested de Havilland be cast so that she could do justice to the part. In this final collaboration, she piles all her considerable acting skill into what is, at heart, basically a romping adventure movie, and the screen chemistry is rekindled -- for once, she and Flynn get the chance to develop their characters beyond the initial romance into an old married couple, to equally winning effect.<br /><br />The Flynn/de Havilland pairing and the streak of comedy are what have provided this film's durability, when most of Flynn's other Westerns -- held in such affection by the contemporary American public, although allegedly not by their star -- have long since been forgotten. The action scenes are fairly cursory (despite, ironically, the death of an extra in a fall during one of the filmed charges) and the villains of the piece turn out, schoolboy-fashion, to be the same people who were horrid to Our Hero on his very first day at West Point, and thus continue to frustrate him throughout his career. It cuts down on the cast list, but it's a trifle too morally convenient.<br /><br />However, these are quibbles largely irrelevant to a film that never set out to be more than a rousing piece of entertainment. Ably aided and abetted by a sterling group of supporting players (memorably including Anthony Quinn in an all-but-wordless role as the Sioux leader), Errol Flynn gallops his way through the plot courtesy of his usual arsenal: charmingly sheepish looks, unexpected sweetness, mischievous twinkles, flash-point indignation, cheerful fellowship and sheer high-octane charisma. He's a reckless braggart, but you can't help but like him. And it's hard to go away without the tune of ""Garryowen"" threading its jaunty way through your ears for many days thereafter.<br /><br />This is one of Flynn's lasting hits; it also contains a surprising amount of good acting amongst the fun, and is a film worthy of being remembered.",1,save grace film humour play strength star warner brother cast version gener custer cocki dash irrever prankster romant streak unexpect strain ideal robin hood flynn blossom role best action pictur made use talent mischief comic time one no except also benefit return former co star olivia de havilland despit earlier agreement break partnership part strong mind libbi custer better role sweet love interest type grown tire play studio flynn later film see script specif request de havilland cast could justic part final collabor pile consider act skill heart basic romp adventur movi screen chemistri rekindl flynn get chanc develop charact beyond initi romanc old marri coupl equal win effect flynn de havilland pair streak comedi provid film durabl flynn western held affect contemporari american public although allegedli not star long sinc forgotten action scene fairli cursori despit iron death extra fall one film charg villain piec turn schoolboy fashion peopl horrid hero first day west point thu continu frustrat throughout career cut cast list trifl moral conveni howev quibbl larg irrelev film never set rous piec entertain abli aid abet sterl group support player memor includ anthoni quinn wordless role sioux leader errol flynn gallop way plot courtesi usual arsen charmingli sheepish look unexpect sweet mischiev twinkl flash point indign cheer fellowship sheer high octan charisma reckless braggart help like hard go away without tune garryowen thread jaunti way ear mani day thereaft one flynn last hit also contain surpris amount good act amongst fun film worthi rememb

Raoul Walsh is an under-rated genius, his direction is so sweeping, so broad, yet so intimate. the last scene between colonel custer (Flynn), and his wife (de havilland), almost brought me to tears (Not easy for a 24yr old guy!!), its so heart-wrenching. there is also a deep Christian message implicit here, the faith Custer has in taking your glory with you, and the trust, and fidelity of his wife to the extent of letting him go, in order that he fulfils his moral duty to protect the innocent civilians from certain massacre. there is no movie that deals with these issues quite like this. a must-see for anyone who wants to look at this defining moment in American, and military history, from the inside. patriotic, for all the right reasons. i knew Errol Flynn was a star, and De havilland was a screen legend-this only confirms my suspicions that they are among the very greatest!",1,awesom no partnership quit like errol olivia love genuin yet flick captiv sure year ago raoul walsh rate geniu direct sweep broad yet intim last scene colonel custer flynn wife de havilland almost brought tear not easi yr old guy heart wrench also deep christian messag implicit faith custer take glori trust fidel wife extent let go order fulfil moral duti protect innoc civilian certain massacr no movi deal issu quit like must see anyon want look defin moment american militari histori insid patriot right reason knew errol flynn star de havilland screen legend confirm suspicion among greatest
"George Armstrong Custer is known through history as an inept General who led his rgiment to their death at the battle of Little Big Horn. ""They Died with their boots on,"" paints a different picture of General Custer. In this movie he is portrayed as a Flamboyant soldier whose mistakes, and misdeeds are mostly ue to his love for adventure.<br /><br />Errol Flynn plays George Armstrong Custer who we first meet as an over confident recruit at West Point. Custer quickily distinguishes himself from other cadets as beeing a poor student who always seems to be in trouble. Somehow this never appears to bother Custer and only seems to confuse him as he genuinely does not know how he gets into such predicaments. In spite of his poor standing, he eventualy graduates and becomes an officer in the United States Army. Through an error, Custer receives a promotion in rank. Before this can be corrected, he leads a Union regiment into battle against the Confederates. His campaign is successful and Custer becomes an unlikely national hero. Custer returns to his hometown, marries his sweetheart, Libby who is played by Olivia De Havilland. Libby is a very supportive understanding wife who steadfastly stays by his side and follows him into the frontier as he assumes leadership of the Seventh Regiment of the Cavalry. Custer becomes a man of honor who strives to keep peace with the Native Americans. To prove his intentions, he enters into a treaty with Crazy Horse, the leader of the Sioux . When that treaty is jeopardized by a conspiracy to spread a false rumor of gold being found in the Black Hills, Custer sacrifices his own life as well as the lives of the men under his command to prevent the slaughter of thousands of innocent settlers.<br /><br />Errol Flynn dominates each scene in which he appears. He successfully portrays Custer as being flamboyant, arrogant, romantic and funny depending on the mood of the scene. Olivia De Havilland's depiction of Libby Bacon Custer as the love of his life lets us see his tender, more gentle side. The Chemistry between DeHavilland and Flynn, who had acted together in several other movies, is so smooth and it almost makes the viewer feel like they are playing themselves and not the parts of Custer and his wife. The other actors portrayals of their characters truly enhance the performances of Flynn and De Havilland. Anthony Quinn as Crazy Horse, Sidney Greenstreet as General Winfield Scott , Arthur Kennedy as Edward Sharp are among the other actors whose roles have made this movie entertaining.<br /><br />The reviewer would rate this a 4 star movie. While it is not historically accurate, it is very entertaining. The movie has a little bit of everything. It has adventure, comedy and romance, so it appeals to a large variety of audiences. The casting of the characters is excellent and the actors give believable performances which makes you forget it is largely based on fiction instead of fact. The reviewer especially likes that the Native Americans were not shown to be the bad guys but just showed them as wanting to protect their sacred land.<br /><br />",1,georg armstrong custer known histori inept gener led rgiment death battl littl big horn die boot paint differ pictur gener custer movi portray flamboy soldier whose mistak misde mostli ue love adventur errol flynn play georg armstrong custer first meet confid recruit west point custer quickili distinguish cadet bee poor student alway seem troubl somehow never appear bother custer seem confus genuin not know get predica spite poor stand eventuali graduat becom offic unit state armi error custer receiv promot rank correct lead union regiment battl confeder campaign success custer becom unlik nation hero custer return hometown marri sweetheart libbi play olivia de havilland libbi support understand wife steadfastli stay side follow frontier assum leadership seventh regiment cavalri custer becom man honor strive keep peac nativ american prove intent enter treati crazi hors leader sioux treati jeopard conspiraci spread fals rumor gold found black hill custer sacrific life well live men command prevent slaughter thousand innoc settler errol flynn domin scene appear success portray custer flamboy arrog romant funni depend mood scene olivia de havilland depict libbi bacon custer love life let us see tender gentl side chemistri dehavilland flynn act togeth sever movi smooth almost make viewer feel like play not part custer wife actor portray charact truli enhanc perform flynn de havilland anthoni quinn crazi hors sidney greenstreet gener winfield scott arthur kennedi edward sharp among actor whose role made movi entertain review would rate star movi not histor accur entertain movi littl bit everyth adventur comedi romanc appeal larg varieti audienc cast charact excel actor give believ perform make forget larg base fiction instead fact review especi like nativ american not shown bad guy show want protect sacr land
"""Dr. Cameron, a discredited scientist succeeds with his experiment in creating serum the transforms men into wolf-like creatures. Originally developing this formula to help the world, the scientist decides to use his newly created subject to exact revenge upon the scientists who were responsible for his ouster from the scientific community.

This brings the beast out in hulking Glenn Strange (as Petro aka Pedro), who is directed to act like Lon Chaney Jr. in ""Of Mice and Men"". Johnny Downs (as Tom Gregory) and Anna Nagel (as Lenora Cameron) are a likable werewolf hunter and damsel in distress. Certainly, ""The Mad Monster"" is no substitute for ""The Wolf Man""; but, it's a serviceable addendum. The grainy black-and-white photography enhances the foggy, cow-webbed atmosphere.

"Thankfully you don't need a lot of ""book learnin"" to understand where this thing's going... Obviously a poverty row cash-in on Universal's big hit THE WOLF MAN (which was made just one year earlier), this finds the always-watchable George Zucco in another of his patented ""mad doctor"" roles as brilliant, vengeance-minded scientist Lorenzo Cameron. Cameron, who has set up shop deep in the swamp lands of what I'm presuming is the Louisiana bayou, is plotting revenge against four of his former peers who both humiliated him and forced him to resign from his previous job. You see, they scoffed at his claims of being able to mix man with beast to create an unstoppable army of wolfman creatures that would come in handy during war-time. Thankfully Cameron has found the ideal test subject for his wolf blood injections - a hulking, child-like half-wit named Petro (Glenn Strange). Petro is pretty clueless as to what's going on, doesn't ask too many question and lets the doc strap him down to a table and shoot him up with whatever happens to be in his syringe. This results in a time-lapse change of man turning into a werewolf. Cameron lets him out of the mansion using a secret passageway, so you basically get a big guy (Strange was 6'5"") dressed in overalls with a bushy beard, hairy paws and a set of over-sized plastic teeth, running around in the woods the majority of the time. After an eyewitness sees the beast and a little girl is killed, the locals grab their rifles and organize a posse to hunt it down. Dr. Cameron, who can control the beast with a whip and also has a handy antidote to reverse the effect, also drags Petro along to the big city to try to track down the professors who had made a mockery of his original theories and destroyed his reputation in the process. Also hanging around the house is Cameron's daughter Lenora (Anne Nagel), as well as Lenora's nosy reporter boyfriend Tom (Johnny Downs), whose first inclination is that they're dealing with an upright-walking prehistoric creature (!)<br /><br />Though a typically chintzy PRC flick in many ways, with unimpressive sets, cinematography and make-ups, as well as a fairly bland supporting cast, it remains watchable thanks to the histrionics of star George Zucco. I have no clue why Downs received top billing; he shows up half-an-hour in and really doesn't have a whole lot to do, nor is he all that impressive doing it. This is Zucco's show all the way and he's great ranting and raving, talking to himself while fantasizing that he's talking to his peers (""I'm not interested in your imbecilic mouthings!"") and temporarily sliding in and out of sanity. Strange seems to have patterned his performance as the hilariously naive and slow-talking semi-retarded country bumpkin around the entire oeuvre of Lon Chaney Jr., from his turn as Lenny in OF MICE AND MEN, to his performance as the aforementioned WOLF MAN. In any case, Strange and Zucco do a fairly good job playing off one another. My favorite part is when Zucco calls him his ""guinea pig"" in front of a colleague while Petro just sits there grinning and staring at a doorknob.

"OK, I've now seen George Zucco in at least four separate horror/suspense films recently as I worked my way through various 50 pack collections, and I have to say, the guy had a limited range, but he was good at what he did. He wasn't Karloff, but PRC was lucky to have him. <br /><br />But the poor guy was stuck in a kind of back-water ghetto of horror films, and he wasn't good enough to take them to the next level of interest....not with the thread-bare screenplays and direction and budgets he worked under. That's the case here. <br /><br />This movie is, well, slow, stodgy and unexciting for the most part. The ""heroine"" seems to be doomed to be a rent-a-center version of Judy Garland, the ""hero"" is bland as white rice, and the poor guy playing the monster doesn't even get a good transformation scene out of the deal. His make up effects aren't scary at all - he looks like a slightly more shaggy version of a farm hand, is all. <br /><br />It's not a total waste. Zucco looks good on camera, he chews the scenery while managing to deliver some terribly affected and contrived set speeches without flinching or losing the flow. There are some moody B&W shots here and there that don't completely suck. <br /><br />So all in all...this movie helped some ""C"" through ""Z"" level actors pay their rent for another month, and it never sinks below a certain hacked out level of quality.

"OK, this movie seems to have been pretty well covered by earlier comments, but there are a couple of items I wish to add. The mad scientist is producing a serum from the blood of a caged animal in order to turn a man into a werewolf. If we suspend our disbelief enough to buy into that, fine. But the animal in the cage is a coyote. That would make a werecoyote. Did audiences in 1942 not know the difference between a wolf and a coyote? They're easy to tell apart. That's weak.<br /><br />Secondly, this movie was covered in the third episode of MST3k (on the Comedy Channel). It took Joel and the bots a number of episodes to get up to full riffing steam, and they weren't up there quite yet on this one.

"A scientist (George Zucco) wants to create wolf men out of American soldiers to fight the Nazis, but is branded as mad. He uses a simpleton gardener (Glenn Strange) to experiment on by mixing his blood with the blood of a wolf. Strange, constantly embedding his dialogue with the tones of Lon Chaney Jr. in ""Of Mice and Men"", has no idea what's going on, only that he sleepwalks. The victims begin to pile up (including a little girl, which modern viewers might find rather disturbing, and two of Zucco's rivals). There is some good dialogue on how man should not mess with nature (still prevalent today) and play God. Zucco's motives may be honorable, but his methods are most questionable. And then there is his daughter, Anne Nagel, who is sympathetically nice to Strange, yet has no idea of her father's deeds. Johnny Downs is a reporter who gets on Zucco's bad side by questioning him, but wins Nagel's heart, thus creating the usual and always dull romantic subplot in classic horror films. At 77 minutes, this is about 15 minutes longer than usual for a horror film of the early 40's (particularly one out of PRC, who released this one), so the romantic story could have been trimmed for costs and to speed things up a bit. Zucco, fortunately, is never hammy; He left that to Bela Lugosi (who always hammed in a deliciously theatrical manner which endeared him to audiences) and England's Todd Slaughter. But try not to think of ""Bride of the Monster's"" laboratory while looking at the one Zucco works in, or some of Lugosi's dialogue in that now classic cult film. ""Mad Monster"" lacks a cult following more because it is not delightfully bad, just has dull pacing in more than a few spots. For PRC and Monogram lovers, I would recommend ""The Corpse Vanishes"" or ""Fog Island"" higher than this",0,scientist georg zucco want creat wolf men american soldier fight nazi brand mad use simpleton garden glenn strang experi mix blood blood wolf strang constantli embed dialogu tone lon chaney jr mice men no idea go sleepwalk victim begin pile includ littl girl modern viewer might find rather disturb two zucco rival good dialogu man not mess natur still preval today play god zucco motiv may honor method question daughter ann nagel sympathet nice strang yet no idea father deed johnni down report get zucco bad side question win nagel heart thu creat usual alway dull romant subplot classic horror film minut minut longer usual horror film earli particularli one prc releas one romant stori could trim cost speed thing bit zucco fortun never hammi left bela lugosi alway ham delici theatric manner endear audienc england todd slaughter tri not think bride monster laboratori look one zucco work lugosi dialogu classic cult film mad monster lack cult follow not delight bad dull pace spot prc monogram lover would recommend corps vanish fog island higher
"George Zucco was like Boris Karloff in the fact no matter how poor the film he appeared in was, he would always maintain a sense of dignity and turn in a fine performance. ""The Mad Monster"" is no exception to that rule. It is by all standards a poor (if entertaining) film. The filmmakers obviously didn't know how to make the most of their low budget and the script seems as if it was turned out in one or two days. Still, Zucco is fine and believable as the mad scientist.<br /><br />The film itself is enjoyable on a camp level. Normal horror movie fans for the most part won't take a liking to PRC films. However, these ""Poverty Row"" productions have a small but loyal cult following. Occasionally they would rise above their limitations with ""Detour"" being the best example of this. Usually they looked like this. For all its technically poor qualities, ""The Mad Monster"" is an amusing enough way to kill a rainy afternoon. The DVD from Retromedia is recommended, as it pairs this with another PRC production ""The Black Raven"", the original theatrical trailer, and best of all an interview with Glenn Strange talking about his role in this movie.

"I'm working my way through the Horror Classics 50 Movie Pack Collection and THE MAD MONSTER is one of the movies in the set.<br /><br />I am sure that George Zucco was a good actor; but, this was only the second film in which I saw him, the first being DEAD MEN WALK, in which he played two parts. However, even good acting couldn't save THE MAD MONSTER.<br /><br />Zucco plays a mad scientist, Dr. Cameron (who was banned from academia because of his unethical and inhumane experiments). He believes that he can control evolution by bringing out the characteristics of one animal into another.<br /><br />In this case, like so many others of its ilk, it is a transfusion of (I assume) wolf's blood into humans. His goal is to create an invincible army, which he can control through the antidote. The subject of his experiments is his hired hand, a retarded gardener, whose dialogue slows down this snail-paced classic to almost a full-stop. <br /><br />Beyond his experiments, Dr. Cameron also plots revenge on those who discredited him, using his transformed gardener. However, he loses control of his subject, who begins to transform without the transfusion -- yikes! <br /><br />The werewolf transformations are classic Hollywood stop-action / makeup effects.

"A paranoid scientist creates a wolfman by transfusing wolf blood into a meek, quiet, but very large gardener, in order to prove an hypothesis. So the gardener begins nightly rampages and the scientist tries to use him to reclaim his credentials, but is rebuffed by his former colleagues for tampering with nature. Island of Dr Moreau, Frankenstein and various wolfman films all blended together into a terribly dated, goofy, morality play.<br /><br />Though the subject matter is pedantic and unoriginal at best, this film is not too poorly made, and interesting to watch as a representative of horror film making of its time. Like most mad scientist films, this is a weak warning against fooling around with Mother Nature. It doesn't have the power or intellectual challenges of Frankenstein, but it doesn't ever extend its reach anyway. The acting is passable, as is the cinematography, and the film moves along at an entertaining clip. Some of the dialog is utterly ludicrous, but hey... it's just a movie - and a B minus one at that. There are also a few nice shots of a wolf, and a smattering of humor tossed-in to prevent the film from appearing to take itself too seriously - always a plus for this genre.",0,paranoid scientist creat wolfman transfus wolf blood meek quiet larg garden order prove hypothesi garden begin nightli rampag scientist tri use reclaim credenti rebuf former colleagu tamper natur island dr moreau frankenstein variou wolfman film blend togeth terribl date goofi moral play though subject matter pedant unorigin best film not poorli made interest watch repres horror film make time like mad scientist film weak warn fool around mother natur power intellectu challeng frankenstein ever extend reach anyway act passabl cinematographi film move along entertain clip dialog utterli ludicr hey movi b minu one also nice shot wolf smatter humor toss prevent film appear take serious alway plu genr
"This has got to be the most god-awful piece of cinematic crap I have ever watched. It makes Mel Brooks movies Oscar-worthy by comparison. Jim VanBebber needs to be publicly slapped for trying to pass this off as ANY form of entertainment.<br /><br />While some may say that this movie is true to the low budget genre of such classics as ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" or ""Night of the Living Dead"", the production value is not in question. It is VanBebber's ability to cast and present a plausible story line. The casting is deplorable. For the role of Charlie he must have picked the first actor he saw with a beard and long hair. Never mind that this actor's hair came halfway down his back, (Manson's never went much past his shoulders) this actor spoke in a dreadful monotone without so much as a fraction of the personality that Steve Railsback or even Jeremy Davies lent to their portrayals of Manson. The actor chosen to play ""Tex"" Watson had curly blond hair instead of straight dark hair, a fact that anyone who has shown even the most remote interest in the Manson case knows. He looks like a Minnesota farmer on ""Little House on the Prairie"" The actress playing Susan Atkins has a butt wider than Oprah's, While those familiar with the Family members know that ""Clem"" was considered somewhat retarded, the actor portraying him did so in such a campy, Chaplinesque way it was like watching an old Vaudevile act. Instead of Sharon Tate looking like a beautiful pregnant woman, the actress looked like bloated, alcoholic trailer trash. VanBebber speeds up the filming in some places for artistic effect yet this technique hasn't proved remotely useful since ""The Munsters"". The end credits list every known family member yet we are never introduced to the majority of them and those we are introduced to we aren't sure who they are sometimes.<br /><br />Facts are destroyed in this movie as well. ""Lotsapoppa"" did not die in real life, Steven Parent was shot four times, not twice, Abagail Folger did not have her throat slit, Where were Mary Brunner and Bruce Davis during the Himnan Murder? Patricia Krenwinkel never sported a ""Dorothy Hamill"" hair style.<br /><br />The most baffling aspect of this movie is what the modern day ""freaks"" had to do with this movie? Why was the girl wearing a rubber mask with a dildo attached? What was their problem with the journalist? What was the meaning or purpose of the final confrontation? Why were they included, period? The viewer never knows! <br /><br />Holy mackerel, I could go on and on but space prevents it.

"I heard legends about this ""film"" (quotes used so as not to insult films) for a while, so when I finally got the DVD with it, I impatiently started watching it. By the end, I *had* to fast forward through just a few of the most moronic, ineptly made, nonsensical scenes of this pointless childish mess to make it end quicker.<br /><br />This may be the worst film I've even ""touched"" - and I used to be associated with Troma for a while. ""Manson Family"" makes the bottom of Troma's entries look like daring and groundbreaking art-house filmwork.

"I got encouraged to watch this film because I've heard good word of it: it was supposed to be this thrilling true crime milestone, disturbing, shocking... all that jazz. Well, I am disturbed because I spent money on it, and I am shocked that something so God-awful actually got released. That's about it.<br /><br />This is a supposed ""new look"" at Charles Manson's family of insane loser junkies and their murders. But if this is a ""new look"" then it's probably ""new"" as in ""fresh and totally inept"": just watching it gave me a headache and I had to give up trying to make any sense of it or even understand just what the director intended it to be.<br /><br />I suppose I should say something about the plot but fact is, it was so stupid and incoherent that I barely remember if there even WAS a plot at all. There was something about a ""Manson tape"" delivered to a radio DJ (or a TV producer?), then an hour of pointless random footage of ""the family"" in '69, then the Polanski murders (looking like a bad school play) and finally some idiotic part about a bunch of skinheads getting drunk and beating the hell out of one another in an alley (I kid you not), and then it ended (thank God) (Don't ask me to make any sense of that, I'm just recalling what I saw!) The performances were terrible, too. And how difficult is it to make a convincing ""Manson""? Get a short skinny scrawny bloke, put a dirty wig and a shaggy beard on him. There's your Manson. But this ""Manson"" doesn't even look right. He just looks like, uh, a bloke in a cheap wig and a glued on Santa beard painted black.<br /><br />Or maybe that's what this film is actually about: Manson's family didn't make any sense, so this film doesn't make any sense, either. It's symbolic! (Yeah, right) I'm still so angry at spending money on this I stopped my normal lurking on this site and registered just to vote 1 for this film and post this warning that will hopefully prevent others from spending their money on this garbage. Stay away from it, it's not even worth renting.<br /><br />PS. The recent US TV production ""Helter Skelter"" got bad reviews here but I saw it last month (I saw the 1976 original too) and let me tell you, compared to ""Manson Family"", that new Helter Skelter is BRILLIANT and FLAWLESS.

"The only thing of interest about this movie is its subject matter. Taking a look at the Manson ""family"" from the point of view of the family members themselves is a great idea. However, trying to make sense of the uncomprehensible is something that can really only be accomplished in a masterwork -- and this ain't it.<br /><br />Presumably because there was so much information to squeeze into a screenplay, this film was done in a faux documentary style, with reenactments thrown in. Trouble is, the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable, like character, story, theme and so on.<br /><br />Worse, there's an incredibly weak sub-plot thrown in that follows a little band of latter-day Mansonites as they go after a reporter who's working on a story on the anniversary of the killings. It's dumb and pointless, and a complete waste of time.<br /><br />All in all, this movie is one big wasted opportunity. The one ray of sunshine is the acting of Marc Pitman, who plays Tex, who in real life did most of the actual killing. Whereas the female characters come off as giggly airheads in the 60s flashbacks, Pitman manages to convey real feeling.<br /><br />In short, don't bother with this movie.",0,thing interest movi subject matter take look manson famili point view famili member great idea howev tri make sens uncomprehens someth realli accomplish masterwork presum much inform squeez screenplay film done faux documentari style reenact thrown troubl write direct make imposs establish thing make movi watchabl like charact stori theme wors incred weak sub plot thrown follow littl band latter day mansonit go report work stori anniversari kill dumb pointless complet wast time movi one big wast opportun one ray sunshin act marc pitman play tex real life actual kill wherea femal charact come giggli airhead flashback pitman manag convey real feel short bother movi
"Okay, last night, August 18th, 2004, I had the distinct displeasure of meeting Mr. Van Bebble at a showing of the film The Manson Family at the Three Penny in Chicago as part of the Chicago Underground Film Festival. Here's what I have to say about it. First of all, the film is an obvious rip off of every Kenneth Anger, Roman Polanski, Oliver Stone and Terry Gilliam movie I've ever seen. Second of all, in a short Q & A session after the show Mr. Van Bebble immediately stated that he never made any contact with the actual Manson Family members or Charlie himself, calling them liars and saying he wanted nothing to do with them, that the film was based on his (Van Bebble's) take on the trial having seen it all from his living room on TV and in the news (and I'm assuming from the Autobiography and the book Helter Skelter which were directly mimicked through the narrative). So I had second dibs on questions, I asked if he was trying to present the outsider, Mtv, sex drugs and rock 'n roll version and not necessarily the true story. This question obviously pissed off the by now sloshed director who started shouting ""f*** you, shut the f*** up, this is the truth! All those other movies are bullsh**!""<br /><br />Well anyway, I didn't even think about how ridiculous this was until the next day when I read the tagline for the film, ""You've heard the laws side of the story...now hear the story as it is told by the Manson Family."" Excuse me, if this guy has never even spoken to the family and considers them to be liars that he doesn't want to have anything to do with, how in God's name can he tell the story for them!? This is the most ridiculous statement I have ever heard! The film was obviously catered to the sex drugs and rock 'n roll audience that it had no trouble in attracting to the small, dimly lit theatre, and was even more obviously spawned by the sex drugs and rock 'n roll mind of a man who couldn't even watch his own film without getting up every ten minutes to go get more beer or to shout some sort of Rocky Horroresque call line to the actors on screen. This film accomplishes little more than warping the public's image of actual events (which helped shape the state of America and much of the world today) into some sort of Slasher/Comic Book/Porno/Rape fantasy dreamed up by an obviously shallow individual.<br /><br />The film was definitely very impressive to look at. The soundtrack was refreshing as it contained actual samples of Charlie's work with the Family off of his Lie album. The editing was nice and choppy to simulate the nauseating uncertainty of most modern music videos. All in all this film would have made a much better addition to the catalogues at Mtv than to the Underground Film Festival or for that matter the minds of any intellectual observers. I felt like I was at a midnight Rocky Horror viewing the way the audience was dressed and behaving (probably the best part of the experience). The cast was very good with the exception of Charlie who resembled some sort of stoned Dungeons and Dragons enthusiast more than the actual role he was portraying. The descriptions the film gave of him as full of energy, throwing ten things at you and being very physical about it all the while did not match at all the slow, lethargic, and chubby representation that was actually presented.<br /><br />All in all the film basically explains itself as Sadie (or maybe it was Linda) declares at the end, ""You can write a bunch of bullsh** books or make a bunch of bullsh** movies...etc. etc."" Case in point. Even the disclaimer ""Based on a True Story"" is a dead giveaway, signalling that somewhere beneath this psychedelic garbage heap lay the foundation of an actual story with content that will make and has made a difference in the world. All you have to do is a little bit of alchemy to separate the truth from the the crap, or actually, maybe you could just avoid it all together and go read a book instead.<br /><br />All I can say is this, when the film ended I got a free beer so I'm glad I went, but not so glad I spent fifteen dollars on my ticket to be told to shut the f*** up for asking the director a question.

"Black and white satire of a Madison Avenue ad agency being taken over by blacks. They're headed by Putney Swope (Arnold Johnson) who is determined to change things. However he turns out to be even WORSE than his white predecessors. That's about as original as this gets.<br /><br />I'm sure this was considered daring and shocking in 1969 but it just seems silly today. The jokes are either unfunny (the president is a midget. HOW is this funny?), cruel or obvious and the film is full of unlikable characters. It's done in a very experimental way which makes it even harder to take...or understand. The movie just gets more bizarre and surreal as it goes along. The ending comes out of nowhere. To make it worse, with the sole exception of Johnson, ALL the acting is bad. Antonio Fargas (a regular in these types of films) is especially annoying as the Arab. This gets three stars because the commercial parodies (done in bright color) ARE amusing and there's a rare good line here and there.

"Strikes me as routine, as far as TV movies go. I can believe that it's based on a true story because the plot seems too clumsy to have been written by anyone with storytelling skills.<br /><br />For instance, good old John Ritter (now a rather bulky and bearded villain) poisons his wife enough to make her ill, then accuses her of being psychosomatic and leaves to marry another young woman immediately. Fourteen years pass before the story picks up again. Why fourteen years? I would guess that though the narrative doesn't demand it, history does.<br /><br />Some of the particular scenes, however, are so cinematically apt that they were almost certainly dreamed up by a writer. Pawing through her attic, Helgenberger, Ritter's first wife, stumbles across an old electrical appliance and has one of those black-and-white flashbacks with stings on the score -- suddenly she recalls when, fourteen years ago, she discovered Ritter shaving selenium filings from a rectifier, carefully collecting them, and putting them in her shampoo and her eyelash liner (or whatever it's called). Later it develops that he was putting it into her coffee as well.<br /><br />Frankly, I don't believe it. I don't believe either that she had that particular epiphany in the attic or that Ritter put selenium shavings into her shampoo or eyeliner. Selenium is referred to in the movie as a ""toxic metal"" and I suppose it is, in sufficient quantity, but it's also an anti-oxidant that's sold over the counter in drug stores and swallowed. Someone will have to demonstrate -- as no one does in this movie -- that it is a topical poison. Many people have tried the nicotine patch and failed. So how come some selenium in her shampoo gives Marg Helgenberger immediate and drastic headaches? And her eyes become as painful as boils when she applies makeup? I think the anthropologist E. B. Tylor called this simple-minded idea ""sympathetic magic,"" but I'm not sure.<br /><br />Mais je divage. Anyway Ritter evidently tries the same stunt with his second wife fourteen years later, although no evidence of trickery is ever produced when she becomes ill with the same symptoms. Wife Number Two is taken to Mexico and apparently cured but suddenly drops dead shortly after her return. Circumstantial evidence piles up against Ritter, who plays the villain with all the stops out -- when his first trial is dismissed he SMIRKS at Helgenberger, who has prompted the investigation.<br /><br />You see, Helgenberger was good friends with Ritter's second wife and was terribly disturbed at her demise and its manner. (I'll bet.) And she wants to prevent the same thing from happening to the wealthy young woman who seems lined up for third place in Ritter's marital schedule. (Sure.) The best performance is given by the guy who plays Detective Mauser -- Lawrence Dane? Everyone else acts by the numbers. They project emotions and thoughts with the subtlety of a warning at a railroad crossing. But Dane does little things that are original. ""I'm told you want to report a murder. (Long pause while he sits down and waits), then abruptly thrusts his face towards Helgeberger and inquires in a reasonable and curious voice, ""So who was murdered""? I suppose except for the bare bones of the historical events, nothing prevented characters or their actions from being drawn differently than they were in real life. I mean, what the heck, Ritter is still in jail convicted of murder and Helgenberger's character is dead, so who is to object? I wish the forensic stuff had been made clearer. Ritter seems to have used so many poisons and toxic metals -- let me see, selenium, cyanide, a massive dose of chlorine, and maybe something else -- that I was confused by it all. Not that I was rooting for Ritter. Here's a mathematician with a Ph.D. who insists people call him ""doctor."" He even corrects people who address him merely as ""professor."" Most Ph.D.s get that narcissistic problem behind them very quickly. ""Jes' call me Whitey, even though I know how to get a standard deviation and you don't.""

The wardrobe designer doesn't seem to have much to do, as the actors wear very down to earth clothes, and actually most of the time they are naked anyway.<br /><br />The film is very dialog heavy, which should have made up for the shortcomings described above. However, the dialogs sound too composed and awkward. In the beginning of the film, most of the dialog is a person saying a very long sentence, and then the person says 'Me too'. After the frenzy of agreement, the dialog descends into a mess of disjointed and confused word salad.<br /><br />The only merit of this film I can think of is that it serves as a feminist outlet which conveys that it is not just men who can be unfaithful.<br /><br />This film is a great disappointment.",0,film woman fall love friend boyfriend divid time two boyfriend jack day joseph night film feel like made minimum budget major film set flat minim furnitur three main actor actor list credit make momentari appear wardrob design seem much actor wear earth cloth actual time nake anyway film dialog heavi made shortcom describ howev dialog sound compos awkward begin film dialog person say long sentenc person say frenzi agreement dialog descend mess disjoint confus word salad merit film think serv feminist outlet convey not men unfaith film great disappoint
I was looking forward to watching this film and was therefore extremely disappointed when I found it to be complete and utter rubbish. Akerman's direction is both heavy handed and cliched (how much more cliched can you get than Paris at night?). The male cast seems to have been chosen entirely for their resemberlance to Egon Schiele's angst ridden self portraits. Yet the themes of jealousy and betrayal which should have been the primary focus of a film of this type are left virtually unexplored. What is left is a turgid melodrama which takes an age to get started and even longer to finish. The only advantage with this sort of film is that it makes you realise how good Goddard and Truffaut really are.,0,look forward watch film therefor extrem disappoint found complet utter rubbish akerman direct heavi hand clich much clich get pari night male cast seem chosen entir resemberl egon schiel angst ridden self portrait yet theme jealousi betray primari focu film type left virtual unexplor left turgid melodrama take age get start even longer finish advantag sort film make realis good goddard truffaut realli
"This HBO original is pretty straightforward and pretty dumb. Armand Assante, once again doing a poor Stallone imitation, is Ray Wellman a ex-con just out on parole. All he wants is his old girlfriend Lacy, played by a young Marcia Gay Harden, back. Unfortunately for Ray, Lacy has hooked up with stalwart Elliot, played by Sam Neill. Further complicating matters is that Ray's old Cell buddies want some favors and they kidnap Lacy to make sure they happen. Ray and Elliot team up, despite mutual dislike.<br /><br />What follows is violent and slow, but Marcia Gay Harden shows us why she would win Oscar in the future, she's not as polished here, but her raw emotion, sincerity and some rather explicit nude scenes almost make this worth watching.

"I was expecting ""Born to Kill"" to be an exciting, high-tension film noir. Instead, it's got two good action set-pieces (one at the beginning and one at the end) and some marvelously atmospheric cinematography by Robert de Grasse (usually a ""glamor"" cameraman and a surprising credit for a noir), but the rest of the film is pretty boring. Lawrence Tierney goes through his psycho kick but it's a strictly by-the-numbers performance, mechanically churning out what the audience expected from him after ""Dillinger"" (an overrated movie but at least better than this). Claire Trevor's character is too stupid and unmotivated to have any audience appeal, and the action (such as it is) stays so resolutely inside that damned house in San Francisco the film becomes claustrophobic instead of genuinely thrilling. It's one of those movies in which the supporting players -- notably Elisha Cook, Jr. (whose character's homoerotic itch for Tierney's is one of the few subtleties in an otherwise pretty obvious script) and Isabel Jewell -- out-act the leads. It also doesn't help that, nearly half a century after Alfred Hitchcock and Anthony Perkins revolutionized the depiction of psycho killers on the screen in ""Psycho,"" Tierney's is so gross and obvious he might as well have ""PSYCHO"" tattooed on his forehead. Also, there's no indication in the film as it stands as to why the source novel was called ""Deadlier than the Male"" -- but perhaps James Gunn made the female characters stronger and more interesting than they are in the film. ""Born to Kill"" is a real disappointment from Robert Wise, who already had some quality movies under his belt and would go on to a stellar career.",0,expect born kill excit high tension film noir instead got two good action set piec one begin one end marvel atmospher cinematographi robert de grass usual glamor cameraman surpris credit noir rest film pretti bore lawrenc tierney goe psycho kick strictli number perform mechan churn audienc expect dilling overr movi least better clair trevor charact stupid unmotiv audienc appeal action stay resolut insid damn hous san francisco film becom claustrophob instead genuin thrill one movi support player notabl elisha cook jr whose charact homoerot itch tierney one subtleti otherwis pretti obviou script isabel jewel act lead also help nearli half centuri alfr hitchcock anthoni perkin revolution depict psycho killer screen psycho tierney gross obviou might well psycho tattoo forehead also no indic film stand sourc novel call deadlier male perhap jame gunn made femal charact stronger interest film born kill real disappoint robert wise alreadi qualiti movi belt would go stellar career
"Fellow Giallo-fanatics: beware and/or proceed with caution  for this movie isn't exactly what it appears to be. It surely looks like a Giallo, with its juicy VHS cover (showing a busty naked girl and a big bloodied knife), rhythmic title and the names of two veteran Italian actors in the cast (John Phillip & Fernando Rey), but it's basically just an erotic thriller without much of a plot. The version I watched is presumably harshly censored  with a running time of barely 77 minutes  but then still there's a severe lack of suspense, character development and most of all sadistic (and typically Giallo) carnage. ""Eyes Behind the Wall"" can briefly be summarized as the gathering of a bunch of perverted characters and the extended depiction of their sexuality issues. It's an interesting effort notwithstanding, because writer/director Giuliano Petrelli (his only film) clearly attempted to do something special, but the overall result is unsatisfying and regrettably tame. Inspired by Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"", the main character is a frustrated elderly and wheelchair-bound writer. He and his much younger lover get their sexual kicks from spying on the single male tenant living across the road. The tenant, respectively, likes to perform gym exercises around the house whilst being naked and clearly has bisexual desires. Wheelchair guy sends his wife over and they have sex. Then, there's also Ottavio the butler who repeatedly rapes schoolgirls. Are there any normal characters in the story? Well no, of course not! The film benefices from a continuously ominous atmosphere, with a moody soundtrack and nifty photography, but none of it ever leads anywhere so it's all just sleaze & sex without significance. There's a truly bizarre twist/revelation at the end of the story, but it comes too late and too randomly to boost up the overall quality.

"I'm almost embarrassed to admit to seeing CALIGULA twice. The problems with the production are almost too numerous to mention. The script is sub-standard (it's easy to see why Vidal tried to disown it). The direction is worse. Most of the movie consists of long shots inter cut with close-ups interspersed with cross cuts of mostly un-erotic porn (more prevalent obviously in the ""uncut"" version). The cinematography is especially sub par, giving the whole production a cheap washed-out look that undermines some of the elaborate set designs. The movie should've looked a whole lot better. The overall concept of placing name actors in what would've easily been an X-rated movie (Guccione called it ""paganography"") wears thin after the first hour after Peter O'Toole and John Guilgud exit. Bob Guccione obviously lavished a lot of bucks on this but it all seems like a big waste.

"I rated this movie a 3 and that was generous. The scenery is ponderous and gaudy, the acting for the most part is terrible. I do think Peter O'Toole did a good job of acting (Tiberius), but he must have been mortified when he saw the final cut of the movie. John Gielgud, howsoever brief his appearance in the movie, still seemed to be playing a role from Hamlet. The hard core pornography parts were neither erotic nor did they do much to further the story. Okay Malcolm McDowell had a nice butt and the guy who played Macro was handsome. The guy who played Claudius, looked more like the traditional depictions of Nero and was certainly at odds with Robert Graves' picture of Claudius. The climactic (?) assassination of Caligula, wife and child is inaccurate in that it shows him after death lying on stairs in an open-air area, when in fact he was assassinated in the underground passage on the palatine hill which ran along the front of the Domus Flaviana that still exists today. There are places in this movie where virtually anything drew my attention away from it--merciful distractions.

"""Caligula"" shares many of the same attributes as the 1970 ""Fellini Satyricon"" with bizarre sights, freakishness, and depictions of sexual excesses all set in the ""glory"" of ancient Rome. But Fellini it ain't... First of all it is not as entertaining. Far too much screen time is devoted to bug-eyed, rubber-faced McDowell in the titular role. His performance is far too fey and campy to be convincing. The portrayals by Jay Robinson in ""The Robe"" (1953) and David Cain-Haughton in ""Emperor Caligula"" (1983) are far more persuasive and believable, with the latter being the most nuanced. Relief could have been judiciously provided by developing the surrounding characters more fully. As it is, they are little more than cyphers. One example is the role of Macro, played by Guido Mannari who has tremendous screen presence in an important role, but is mostly left in the background. The only positive features to credit are the adroit use of some Prokofiev and Stravinsky themes in the music score and the inclusion of some of the distasteful but nevertheless accurate actions of the despot. These two factors are far less than what is needed to relieve the prevailing tedium, however.",0,caligula share mani attribut fellini satyricon bizarr sight freakish depict sexual excess set glori ancient rome fellini first not entertain far much screen time devot bug eye rubber face mcdowel titular role perform far fey campi convinc portray jay robinson robe david cain haughton emperor caligula far persuas believ latter nuanc relief could judici provid develop surround charact fulli littl cypher one exampl role macro play guido mannari tremend screen presenc import role mostli left background posit featur credit adroit use prokofiev stravinski theme music score inclus distast nevertheless accur action despot two factor far less need reliev prevail tedium howev
"Writer & director Robert Downey, Sr., a pioneer of the underground film movement in the 1960s, satirized the New York Madison Avenue advertising world with his avant-garde comedy ""Putney Swope."" Downey doesn't confine his ridicule to advertising, but tackles black militant culture, the dynamics in Hollywood's portrayal of race, the elite white power structure, and character of corruption in any power struggle. As audacious and ambitious as ""Putney Swope"" strives to be, it qualifies as a terrible film, amateurishly made on a shoe-string budget with a no-name cast and humor that lacks hilarity. Everything about this movie reeks with improvisation. ""Putney Swope"" stirred up controversy during its initial release with its politically incorrect handling of race issues and consumer culture. Like most Marx Brothers movies, the plot is thin, providing an excuse for Downey's anecdotal gags, most of which are terrible.<br /><br />The chairman of a prestigious Madison Avenue ad agency dies during a board meeting. Before the body has been removed, the board holds a secret ballot vote to determine who will replace him. Each member understands that they are forbidden to vote for himself. Sheer accident occurs when everyone votes for the token black member, Putney Swope (Arnold Johnson), since none thought anybody would cast a ballot for him. Swope pink slips all but one of the white executives, surrounds himself with black, pistol packing employees, and renames the firm ""Truth and Soul Advertising."" Swope decides to alter the face of American advertising. He refuses to accept clients whose products are alcohol, tobacco, or war toys. Swope's clients stage an exodus after he becomes the CEO, and grandstanding attracts a new line-up of clients that show up at his office lugging bags of money and prepared to suffer abuse from Swope's militant employees. Swope exploits his African-American staff, too, ruthlessly appropriating their ideas after he fires them and conjures up a number of offensive advertising campaigns, all of which are hailed as a 'new wave' of marketing genius. Incredibly, Swope's conservatism proves successful but the agency becomes the target of government operatives who argue Swope's advertising tactics constitute ""a threat to the national security."" The high point of this black & white, 85-minute comedy are the television commercials shot in color. Unfortunately, Downey doesn't know when to cut off these ads that consistently start out cleverly but wear out their welcome. The funniest part of ""Putney Swope"" involves our eponymous protagonist's dealings with U.S. President Mimeo in Washington D.C. (Pepi Hermine), a marihuana-toking midget with a Kissinger-like Teutonic adviser (Larry Wolf) spouting tasteless jokes while trying to convince Swope to come up with an advertising campaign for his new car, the Borman 6.",0,writer director robert downey sr pioneer underground film movement satir new york madison avenu advertis world avant gard comedi putney swope downey confin ridicul advertis tackl black milit cultur dynam hollywood portray race elit white power structur charact corrupt power struggl audaci ambiti putney swope strive qualifi terribl film amateurishli made shoe string budget no name cast humor lack hilar everyth movi reek improvis putney swope stir controversi initi releas polit incorrect handl race issu consum cultur like marx brother movi plot thin provid excus downey anecdot gag terribl chairman prestigi madison avenu ad agenc die board meet bodi remov board hold secret ballot vote determin replac member understand forbidden vote sheer accid occur everyon vote token black member putney swope arnold johnson sinc none thought anybodi would cast ballot swope pink slip one white execut surround black pistol pack employe renam firm truth soul advertis swope decid alter face american advertis refus accept client whose product alcohol tobacco war toy swope client stage exodu becom ceo grandstand attract new line client show offic lug bag money prepar suffer abus swope milit employe swope exploit african american staff ruthlessli appropri idea fire conjur number offens advertis campaign hail new wave market geniu incred swope conservat prove success agenc becom target govern oper argu swope advertis tactic constitut threat nation secur high point black white minut comedi televis commerci shot color unfortun downey know cut ad consist start cleverli wear welcom funniest part putney swope involv eponym protagonist deal u presid mimeo washington c pepi hermin marihuana toke midget kissing like teuton advis larri wolf spout tasteless joke tri convinc swope come advertis campaign new car borman

Many years ago a pirate copy of THE THING ( 1982 version ) was doing the rental rounds on my Island and it been copied onto a rental tape of CALIGULA meaning the pirate version of THE THING starts with the first few seconds of CALIGULA of the man and woman walking through the forest then the title sequence of THE THING starts . This led people who`d seen the pirate tape to believe the forest scene was the opening of John Carpenter`s 1982 film and were very confused as to what it meant.

"Who really wants to see that? Disgusting violence, disgusting sex, for such a long time. I do not want to, but I always stayed true to my philosophy to watch any movie as bad as it may be. This was the hardest (right after ""Next Friday"").<br /><br />It's basically just crap. How can you possibly call it anything else? The story of a Roman emperor as an excuse for gore and T&A. Yeah, yeah, ""Hey, it's realistic, they have been like this."" Fine, but why bother us with it? I don't care if it has been like this (and there are a lot of scenes where I truly doubt it). The point is, why should anyone wanna see it? Problem is, there is only one reason you could like the film and that would be that you like violence. There's nothing special about it, just cruelty. You can say ""Cool!"" as you'd say in splatter-slasher-movie. But horror movies with violence at least can give you chills and excitement, maybe characters you care about. But here everything is dark, dull and boring. Every character is mad. ""The story of an emperor who can't deal with his power"". What? In the very first scene he runs naked through the woods with his sister! I have no problem saying that we saw a madman for 2 1/2 hours.<br /><br />But maybe you get turned on by seeing Helen Mirren, being pregnant and dancing. Or 5 minutes of hardcore scenes that some people see as the message of the movie. Or castration, yeah right, that was fun! Real birth scenes, how hilarious!

"As a semi-film buff, I had heard of this infamous movie a long time ago. I had heard that it was basically a 15 million dollar film about the tyrannical rule of the Roman emperor Caligula, complete with hard-core pornography. What struck me was that it was a porno movie yet it had great thespians like Peter O'Toole, John Geilgud, Malcolm McDowell and Hellen Mirren in it!!?? A week ago I saw a documentary about Caligula on the History channel and this film came back into my head and finally my curiousity got the best of me, I foolishly rented the DVD and even more foolishly watched it.<br /><br />Within the first 30 minutes I was seeing acts of sex and especially violence that would earn an NC-17 even by todays standards. Was it really necessary to have a scene of a man having his urinary track closed and then have gallons of wine poured into him and then have his stomach cut with a sword (all in very graphic detail). And a scene where a guy gets his d*** cut off and fed to dogs (again in very graphic detail)....and this just scratches the surface. The argument for this movie from those who like it seems that it is the only film that honestly portrays pagan Rome and it's excesses. When in fact what this movie really is, is sheer exploitation. From beginning to end you see nothing but endless torture, and decapitations and every kind of violence and crude behavior imaginable (sadomasochism, rape, necrophelia, it just never stopped). There is no insight into Caligula himself, what might have propelled him to go mad, the horrible childhood he had that molded him into a sadist as an adult. This is not a historic film, it is sleaze. Even the porn in this movie stinks, and through much of this when I wasn't gagging I was just incredibly bored. By the time it was over I was depressed, didn't feel much like eating and this movie does the impossible, it actually can turn you off of sex.<br /><br />What were these great actors thinking when they got into this. I did read that the porn segments were filmed after the principal shooting was completed (which explains why none of the main actors are in any of these scenes and why the quality of these scenes is so poor). But still and all these actors must have known what they were getting into. Right at the opening credits it says ""Penthouse Magazine and Bob Gucionne Presents"". And the scenes that the famous actors actually take part in are completely repulsive in and of themselves. Apparently director Tinto Brass wanted his name removed from the completed film entirely, as did the screenwriter (Gore Vidal of all people). Even John Geilgud and Peter O'toole were begging people not to see this when it opened at the Cannes film festival.<br /><br />For the amount of money the producers spent on this, the movie's quality is terrible. Everything is underlit and murky as if the film was dropped in a swamp prior to being developed, and that's when you're lucky enough to view a scene that's actually in-focus. The sound is poorly dubbed, much of the music is awkward and the editing is god awful.<br /><br />Anyway, I brought this movie on myself. My advice...don't watch this, don't watch this, don't watch this......as for myself tomorrow night I am going to watch something lighter....like DAWN OF THE DEAD!",0,semi film buff heard infam movi long time ago heard basic million dollar film tyrann rule roman emperor caligula complet hard core pornographi struck porno movi yet great thespian like peter tool john geilgud malcolm mcdowel hellen mirren week ago saw documentari caligula histori channel film came back head final curious got best foolishli rent dvd even foolishli watch within first minut see act sex especi violenc would earn nc even today standard realli necessari scene man urinari track close gallon wine pour stomach cut sword graphic detail scene guy get cut fed dog graphic detail scratch surfac argument movi like seem film honestli portray pagan rome excess fact movi realli sheer exploit begin end see noth endless tortur decapit everi kind violenc crude behavior imagin sadomasoch rape necrophelia never stop no insight caligula might propel go mad horribl childhood mold sadist adult not histor film sleaz even porn movi stink much gag incred bore time depress feel much like eat movi imposs actual turn sex great actor think got read porn segment film princip shoot complet explain none main actor scene qualiti scene poor still actor must known get right open credit say penthous magazin bob gucionn present scene famou actor actual take part complet repuls appar director tinto brass want name remov complet film entir screenwrit gore vidal peopl even john geilgud peter tool beg peopl not see open cann film festiv amount money produc spent movi qualiti terribl everyth underlit murki film drop swamp prior develop lucki enough view scene actual focu sound poorli dub much music awkward edit god aw anyway brought movi advic watch watch watch tomorrow night go watch someth lighter like dawn dead
"210 minute version (extremely hardcore, or so I hear) or the R-rated version released into theaters? Both are terribly awful, of course.

"Although its plot is taken from the history of ancient Rome, 'Caligula' is not made in the style of sword-and-sandal epics like 'Spartacus' or 'Gladiator'. (That style of movie-making was out of favour in the late seventies). Rather, it more closely resembles a cross between a soft-core porn movie and a video nasty. At least, the shortened 150 minute version does. I have never seen the full 210 minute version, but to judge from the descriptions of it on this page, it would seem closer to a cross between a hard-core porn movie and a video nasty. <br /><br />As one would expect from a film produced by the publisher of 'Penthouse', there is much naked flesh to be seen, and the film lovingly catalogues Caligula's sexual perversions, including his incestuous affair with his sister Drusilla. What is perhaps unexpected from the publisher of a magazine so closely associated with the heterosexual male lifestyle is that there is as much male flesh as female on display and distinctly homoerotic overtones to many scenes. The obsession with sex is balanced by an equal obsession with violence, as though Bob Guccione, Gore Vidal and Tinto Brass were trying to kill two taboos with one stone. (It is a remarkable coincidence that the director of such a brazen film should be called 'Brass' and the scriptwriter of such a gory one should be called 'Gore'). Characters are put to death or mutilated in a variety of sadistic ways, and there is a charming scene of homosexual rape. <br /><br />The Emperor Caligula and his predecessor Tiberius were certainly known for their debauched lifestyles, so the film's concentration on sex and violence is not necessarily historically inaccurate. I do, however, question whether such a concentration is necessary to help us understand this period in Roman history. Both 'The Fall of the Roman Empire' and 'Gladiator' were set during the reign of Commodus, an Emperor quite as cruel and licentious as Caligula. In neither case did the filmmakers find it necessary to turn their film into a mixture of 'Up Pompeii!', 'Emmanuelle' and 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre', and both those films are artistically far better than 'Caligula'.<br /><br />The acting in the film is not particularly bad, with a few exceptions such as the horribly wooden Teresa Ann Savoy as Drusilla. Malcolm McDowell makes a suitably insane Caligula. (Suitable, that is, in the context of this film. The real Caligula was doubtless both cruel and eccentric, but historians have debated whether he was actually mentally ill). The great mystery is exactly why so many distinguished British actors should have agreed to take part in such a trashy production. In the case of Helen Mirren (the only Dame of the British Empire with a past as a porn star) it was probably connected to her rather regrettable tendency to alternate between the highbrow and the sleazy, but heaven alone knows what Peter O'Toole and John Gielgud thought they were doing. Unlike some other famous stage actors, such as Laurence Olivier and Richard Burton, Gielgud did not always look completely at home in the cinema, but here he gives a dignified interpretation of the role of Nerva, a decent and honourable Senator of the old school. Unfortunately, in the context of this film any attempt at dignity is as out of place as a pearl on a dunghill. <br /><br />Guccione clearly succeeded in his ambition for this film to become something of a cult classic of decadence. (Whether Brass and Vidal had quite the same ambition for the film is open to question).

"I found the movie at my local video store and I was surprised to see it on DVD. I had heard about the explicit sex scenes, gruesome violence, and the notorious debauchery. I sat and watched and I began laughing! The set decorations and art direction was cheap and fake; the nudity was sardonic and incredibly unsexy; the story was poorly written and it was just a parade of incredibly beautiful and talented actors being held hostage to quote the worst dialogue ever written! The incestuous relationship between Caligola (Malcolm McDowell) and his serenely beautiful sister Drusilla (Theresa Ann Savoy, a vulnerable beauty) can't be taken seriously...it's not even shocking or repulsive! Peter O'Toole and John Geilgud were obviously held hostage during the making of this film luckily they die in the first thirty minutes of the film. The cinematography was a joke and I was even more amused when they used a quote from the Bible! The book of Mark no less. If you are looking for shock value, this movie will disappoint you. If you are looking for camp cult value, you will be even more disappointed. I know I was.

"As an ancient movie fan, I had heard much about the controversial movie CALIGULA assessed ambiguously as one of the most realistic epics by some and as one of the most disgusting porn movies by others. I decided to see it in the entire uncut version to evaluate it myself hoping to find something positive that would make justice to the many accusations towards the film. I sat down in my chair one autumn evening and started to watch. The beginning quotation from the New Testament shocked me a bit and raised the first controversy in me...why to entail a sentence from the Gospel by Mark in the movie about pagan Rome? But the prelude pastoral scene with a young half naked couple (Caligula and Drusilla) running hopelessly through meadows seemed quite sentimental. The music which sounded memorably whilst the credits also provoked me in the positive sense. Yet, the negative feelings raised in me quite soon, particularly at the death of Tiberius. The cruelty seemed very intense and sexuality exaggerated. However, it was not that horrific to the middle. During the second half of the film, I felt as if I watched no historical epic but an extremely disgusting porn. In the end, I said to myself ""This is one of the movies that one may really hate"" ... I am aware that a movie may be controversial but I had never expected that CALIGULA would go that far in removing all limits of taste. I hate this film due to many reasons, but particularly one.<br /><br />CALIGULA does not serve a purpose of an ancient epic (which it claims to be), but Bob Guccione, the director and the founder of Penthouse pornographic magazine, aims at combining film art with porn. That is, I think, the most serious matter the film may be accused of. Movie is an art that should be reigned by taste, by message, by some feeling of epic grandeur whereas this movie kills all limits of good taste. CALIGULA shows the most bestial side of human being in the most wicked, decadent manner. Some scenes are so disgusting that I don't think there are any people whose psyches will not be affected by them. Some say that the Rome under Caligula's reign was so brutal. Yes, it is true. Corruption bloomed at that time, various sexual deviances were preferable to Roman citizens. Yet, I do not think that it is right to focus on these deviations so strictly and make it constitute an emphasis of an ancient epic. I believe that it rather proves the bizarre psyches of the producers and their strange tendencies... <br /><br />HUGE HISTORICAL MISTAKES: The screenplay by Gore Vidal is notorious for inaccuracies. It is noticeable, for instance, with the figure of Proculus (Donato Placido), a historic Roman senator. Yet, the film shows him as a simple soldier on whom Caligula forces his most decadent ways of tortures and rapes. Moreover, Livia was not Proculus wife raped by Caesar on her wedding. What lies behind changing the stories of historical characters into the stories filled with unbelievable vulgarity and violence? Another example of historical travesty is the figure of Caesonia portrayed by Helen Mirren. She is presented as Caligula's wife together with Drusilla, his sister. In fact, Caligula married Caesonia long after the death of his sister. The sexual abuse on his new wife in the temple is a hilarious scene with no historical bases. I also hated the moment with the killing machine - a pure imagination of the director that has nothing to do with historical facts. <br /><br />TECHNICAL ASPECT AND CAST: From the technical point of view, the film is nothing special. The cinematography cannot boast to be exceptionally fine and the sets together with costumes are as well nothing outstanding. Yet, the only strong point of the movie are the performances, particularly the one by Malcolm McDowall as Caligula. He does a perfect job in the main role portraying madness and cruelty of the emperor. McDowall raises the value of the film. If everything bothers you in CALIGULA, you may at least admire his performance. I also fancied Helen Mirren as Caesonia and Teresa Ann Savoy as Drusilla (yet the film is based on a gossip by Suetonius that Caligula made love to his sister). Sir John Gielgud as Nerva and Peter O'Toole as old Tiberius are also memorable. O'Toole does his finest piece of acting in the Capri Grotto sequence portraying the decadence and the exhaust of the old emperor. Yes, I admit that THE ONLY THING I like about CALIGULA are the performances. Therefore, I don't rate the movie 1/10.<br /><br />LAME CONTINUITY: The historical inaccuracy of the film also goes in pairs with poor continuity. Let us analyze just the beginning: Caligula comes to Capri Grotto where he sees the awful pleasures of old Tiberius. Then, after about 15 minutes, the action moves to Rome where a black bird near Drusilla and Caligula's bed constitutes a bad omen. And immediately the characters are again in Capri where Nerva (John Gielgud) is dying...? <br /><br />All in all, I don't recommend to see CALIGULA to anyone. If you want to know the story, read Robert Graves' gorgeous novel I, CLAUDIUS and CLAUDIUS THE GOD or watch Herbert Wise's mini series with the magnificent performance by Derek Jacobi. CALIGULA is a sick film the most serious crime of which is the destruction of art. It is, in its most part, a porn movie that should never be called an epic.<br /><br />There are movies that are truly artistic and sharpen people's taste of beauty,<br /><br />there are movies that are average entertainment; yet they have something to offer,<br /><br />there are movies that show extreme violence; yet they still convey some moral,<br /><br />there are, however, movies that show sickness and decadence for their own sake and consequently harm people's minds,<br /><br />CALIGULA unfortunately belongs to the latest group",0,ancient movi fan heard much controversi movi caligula assess ambigu one realist epic one disgust porn movi other decid see entir uncut version evalu hope find someth posit would make justic mani accus toward film sat chair one autumn even start watch begin quotat new testament shock bit rais first controversi entail sentenc gospel mark movi pagan rome prelud pastor scene young half nake coupl caligula drusilla run hopelessli meadow seem quit sentiment music sound memor whilst credit also provok posit sens yet neg feel rais quit soon particularli death tiberiu cruelti seem intens sexual exagger howev not horrif middl second half film felt watch no histor epic extrem disgust porn end said one movi one may realli hate awar movi may controversi never expect caligula would go far remov limit tast hate film due mani reason particularli one caligula not serv purpos ancient epic claim bob guccion director founder penthous pornograph magazin aim combin film art porn think seriou matter film may accus movi art reign tast messag feel epic grandeur wherea movi kill limit good tast caligula show bestial side human wick decad manner scene disgust think peopl whose psych not affect say rome caligula reign brutal ye true corrupt bloom time variou sexual devianc prefer roman citizen yet not think right focu deviat strictli make constitut emphasi ancient epic believ rather prove bizarr psych produc strang tendenc huge histor mistak screenplay gore vidal notori inaccuraci notic instanc figur proculu donato placido histor roman senat yet film show simpl soldier caligula forc decad way tortur rape moreov livia not proculu wife rape caesar wed lie behind chang stori histor charact stori fill unbeliev vulgar violenc anoth exampl histor travesti figur caesonia portray helen mirren present caligula wife togeth drusilla sister fact caligula marri caesonia long death sister sexual abus new wife templ hilari scene no histor base also hate moment kill machin pure imagin director noth histor fact technic aspect cast technic point view film noth special cinematographi cannot boast except fine set togeth costum well noth outstand yet strong point movi perform particularli one malcolm mcdowal caligula perfect job main role portray mad cruelti emperor mcdowal rais valu film everyth bother caligula may least admir perform also fanci helen mirren caesonia teresa ann savoy drusilla yet film base gossip suetoniu caligula made love sister sir john gielgud nerva peter tool old tiberiu also memor tool finest piec act capri grotto sequenc portray decad exhaust old emperor ye admit thing like caligula perform therefor rate movi lame continu histor inaccuraci film also goe pair poor continu let us analyz begin caligula come capri grotto see aw pleasur old tiberiu minut action move rome black bird near drusilla caligula bed constitut bad omen immedi charact capri nerva john gielgud die recommend see caligula anyon want know stori read robert grave gorgeou novel claudiu claudiu god watch herbert wise mini seri magnific perform derek jacobi caligula sick film seriou crime destruct art part porn movi never call epic movi truli artist sharpen peopl tast beauti movi averag entertain yet someth offer movi show extrem violenc yet still convey moral howev movi show sick decad sake consequ harm peopl mind caligula unfortun belong latest group
"Incomprehensibly dreadful mishmash of the probably most notorious of all Roman emperors who went insane, leaving infamous party orgies and ruthless killings in his path... I know there are several versions of this, and this is based on the 102 min' one that I watched - but I can't fathom how that possibly can make any difference to lift the rest of this movie out of the muck!<br /><br />I'd heard for long about the alleged ""shocking"" content of sex/nudity (which honestly there isn't much of here at all - and boring when there is) and blood, but beware - it's the technical production amateurishness that well and truly shocks here: Everything looks plain and simply like a junior film school flunk project! Camera-work is hopelessly inept, full of strange zooms, failed framing and confusing pans (to and from what mostly looks like a huge theater stage!) complete with a grainy, cheapish photo quality. Lighting and color schemes are terrible and uneven - is it day or night? Are they in- or outside? Have they changed scenes? Who is, or is meant to be in the shot? Editing is the final sin here, making a confusing mess of everything with randomly jumpy cutaways, continuity flaws and random transitions that destroy any chance of momentum, story progression - and involvement. There is potentially interesting dialog and an equally interesting true historical story... but these faults distract so much it's tragic.<br /><br />A story with SO many possibilities to be great is just one gargantuan, burnt (and Fellini-like) turkey that's only good for a few gobble-laughs and Peter O'Toole, who makes a most memorable Tiberius. Oh yes, which brings us to the big-name actors. I'd like to line them all up one by one and just ask: Who did you get free access to bonk in the orgies to be a part of this?

"I'm currently slogging through Gibbon's 'Fall and Decline of the Roman Empire , so I've had all things Roman on my mind. I'm not very far into it yet, maybe two hundred plus pages, but it is amazing just how many of these Roman emperors were killed. I believe I've read through maybe 15 emperors so far and only Antonius, Trajan, and Hadrian haven't been killed or at least suspected of having been killed. I have also been fascinated by the mad excesses of many of these princes of Rome. Not the least practitioner of these was Caligula. This brings me to reviewing this film. I'm thinking of the film on a historical basis as far as I understand it from Gibbon's explanation of Rome,as well as other research from some good web sites and some fiction novels dealings with the period.<br /><br />My point is I do not think that this film is what it is thought to be by many of it's proponents. I do not think the depravity shown with the sex and horrendous violence of this film qualify it as accurate. The general ideas of the film seem accurate. Caligula is raised on an island ,exiled with his family and in content fear of being murdered by the increasingly mad, suspicious and strange emperor Tiberius. He grows up paranoid and afraid and can never shake the cutesy nickname given him by his guards, Little Boots, this helps him grow up feeling abused and powerless. He is handed the empire after Tiberius dies, the senate hoping he will steer away from the informer squads which brought death by whim of the former delusionally paranoid tyrant, and lead Rome away from the madness that dictator had settled it into. Caligula begins as a decent if hands-off emperor, but gets sick, almost dies, and comes back from the brink of feverous death a true monster. His perversities with his sisters do begin here, if not before. He does have Macro killed and many others who were his originally supporters. The acts of madness seemed not to be the murders of Caligula as much as his new thinking of himself as a living God. Him seen talking to the statue of Jupiter as an equal doomed him. His violent mad excesses would have doomed him anyway, and three years seems to have been quite a decent run for the successors of Tiberius. Well the film basically sticks to these lines while it manages to be coherent, which is not common through it's entirety, it does so while trying to shock the audience at all turns, in every single scene the film begs you to be disgusted by the depravity of ancient Rome. The shocking scenes are what this film is built entirely upon and where it entirely fails. It is just too much to see successive rulers have man after man murdered, raped, tortured for no reason but fancy. The depictions of the violence are possibly, but not probably, accurate. Murder certainly was the order of the day in Imperial Rome, torture beforehand was rote. But the director's visions of these deaths and the bored amusement of their protagonists, while the bystanders watch with nonchalance, I just don't see it having gone down exactly like that. The death machine, the beheader, is certainly something like you've never seen in movies, and something once seen you shall probably never forget, even as I, you wish you could. The wine drinking while the penis is roped off is the same, once you've seen this shame it is yours forever. These things strike me the director's and that porn magnate's fantasies. They sprung from their sick imaginations and not from any proved record.<br /><br />The acting is pretty good. I actually think Mcdowell is the weakest link here. Mirren is always something to behold, and here in her youthful years she is formidable and beautiful. The portrayals of Nerva and Tiberius are done very well by their respected actors. The film could have done so much better story telling, it is such a failure that way its just a whole other layer of what a shame this thing was. For example it could have given opinion on how and why Caligula went mad, or shown that he was mad, paranoid before his illness and that fever then broke the mental restraint he had possessed previously. It could have shown the weakness of Claudius and the miracle it was he survived Caligula. It could have these and many other things but it stuck to it's sad nightmares.<br /><br />Finally about the sex. It is porn. It shows these sex acts being done all over the palaces by many people. Male on male, female on female, male on female. It is passionless, disgusting sex. Sex that if your point is to get off on it, I seriously doubt you could. Both Tiberius and Caligula may have been sex addicts, and orgies may have been common enough but the visions in this film seem to recall more a Greek time than a Roman. I don't think that kind of acceptance of homosexuality or orgies right out in the open were common until the the strange, depraved reign of Elgabalus, and he was killed for it.<br /><br />This film should probably never be watched, if your curious about it , let it go. It is something, as I said earlier, if you do watch this you will unfortunately retain it's sick visions in your minds eye for years to come. I don't think its an accurate historical picture in particular, even if it is historical in whole.",0,current slog gibbon fall declin roman empir thing roman mind not far yet mayb two hundr plu page amaz mani roman emperor kill believ read mayb emperor far antoniu trajan hadrian kill least suspect kill also fascin mad excess mani princ rome not least practition caligula bring review film think film histor basi far understand gibbon explan rome well research good web site fiction novel deal period point not think film thought mani propon not think deprav shown sex horrend violenc film qualifi accur gener idea film seem accur caligula rais island exil famili content fear murder increasingli mad suspici strang emperor tiberiu grow paranoid afraid never shake cutesi nicknam given guard littl boot help grow feel abus powerless hand empir tiberiu die senat hope steer away inform squad brought death whim former delusion paranoid tyrant lead rome away mad dictat settl caligula begin decent hand emperor get sick almost die come back brink fever death true monster pervers sister begin not macro kill mani other origin support act mad seem not murder caligula much new think live god seen talk statu jupit equal doom violent mad excess would doom anyway three year seem quit decent run successor tiberiu well film basic stick line manag coher not common entireti tri shock audienc turn everi singl scene film beg disgust deprav ancient rome shock scene film built entir upon entir fail much see success ruler man man murder rape tortur no reason fanci depict violenc possibl not probabl accur murder certainli order day imperi rome tortur beforehand rote director vision death bore amus protagonist bystand watch nonchal see gone exactli like death machin behead certainli someth like never seen movi someth seen shall probabl never forget even wish could wine drink peni rope seen shame forev thing strike director porn magnat fantasi sprung sick imagin not prove record act pretti good actual think mcdowel weakest link mirren alway someth behold youth year formid beauti portray nerva tiberiu done well respect actor film could done much better stori tell failur way whole layer shame thing exampl could given opinion caligula went mad shown mad paranoid ill fever broke mental restraint possess previous could shown weak claudiu miracl surviv caligula could mani thing stuck sad nightmar final sex porn show sex act done palac mani peopl male male femal femal male femal passionless disgust sex sex point get serious doubt could tiberiu caligula may sex addict orgi may common enough vision film seem recal greek time roman think kind accept homosexu orgi right open common strang deprav reign elgabalu kill film probabl never watch curiou let go someth said earlier watch unfortun retain sick vision mind eye year come think accur histor pictur particular even histor whole
"It's a rare sensation to come across a film so embarrassing that you feel an urge to turn away from the screen. But when you see a noble actor like Sir John Gielgud surrounded by naked, copulating couples that's just what you'll want to do. Add to that Peter O'Toole as syphilis-ridden emperor Tiberius and Malcolm McDowell sticking his finger up a male victim's anus, and you begin to appreciate that Caligula is solely of interest to addicts of sick/outrageous films.<br /><br />The film charts the life of notorious Roman emperor Caligula (McDowell), a highly disturbed individual whose story is told through a series of sexual encounters, decapitations, betrayals, murders, incestuous relationships and lesbian sex scenes.<br /><br />Although Caligula was totally mad in real life, and probably did succumb to his base instincts more often than not, the film is still inexcusable filth. The sex in the film isn't used as one aspect in a multi-layered story - the sex IS the story. After a while, all the nudity, hip thrusting and nipple sucking becomes tedious due to sheer repetition. The performances are totally undisciplined, particularly McDowell who throws caution to the wind and gives a performance that is all wild-eyed posturing. O'Toole seems to be treating the script with the contempt it deserves (surely he's in it purely for the money?!). Rumours abound that additional pornographic scenes were added without the director's consent during post production, but in truth there isn't a single minute in Caligula that is dignified or well-made. It is doubtful that this amount of time, talent and money will ever be thrown at a porno film again, so in that sense Caligula is a one-of-a-kind experience... on the other hand, it's so monumentally awful that perhaps the fact it is ""one-of-a-kind"" is a blessing in disguise.",0,rare sensat come across film embarrass feel urg turn away screen see nobl actor like sir john gielgud surround nake copul coupl want add peter tool syphili ridden emperor tiberiu malcolm mcdowel stick finger male victim anu begin appreci caligula sole interest addict sick outrag film film chart life notori roman emperor caligula mcdowel highli disturb individu whose stori told seri sexual encount decapit betray murder incestu relationship lesbian sex scene although caligula total mad real life probabl succumb base instinct often not film still inexcus filth sex film use one aspect multi layer stori sex stori nuditi hip thrust nippl suck becom tediou due sheer repetit perform total undisciplin particularli mcdowel throw caution wind give perform wild eye postur tool seem treat script contempt deserv sure pure money rumour abound addit pornograph scene ad without director consent post product truth singl minut caligula dignifi well made doubt amount time talent money ever thrown porno film sens caligula one kind experi hand monument aw perhap fact one kind bless disguis
"Starting with a tearjerking poem and images of american missiles, starving children and mutilated palestinians I quickly realised that this was not going to be a objective documentary. 5 youths convicted after the gothenburg riots are interviewed and give a very confused explaination why they had to trash the citycenter and then (oh my god) actually have pay for what they have done. I kept watching and many questions are raised, were the trial properly done and did the cops have the right to do what they did? Lots of questions asked... and then dropped. No interviews with judges or going through documents about the trial.. nothing.<br /><br />In short: Nothing new from what every Swede has seen on tv a hundred times - just poor propaganda.",0,start tearjerk poem imag american missil starv children mutil palestinian quickli realis not go object documentari youth convict gothenburg riot interview give confus explain trash citycent oh god actual pay done kept watch mani question rais trial properli done cop right lot question ask drop no interview judg go document trial noth short noth new everi swede seen tv hundr time poor propaganda
"I saw this film at the tender age of 18 with a group of friends. Its reputation had preceded it, and though all my friends were also of legal age, I alone had the courage to enter the video store and actually rent it. We gathered at a house where the parents had left town for the weekend. Though we sat in close proximity to each other, we did not speak or otherwise acknowledge each other's presence. As it turned out, the film both merited and did not merit the anticipatory shame we felt. It did not disappoint in terms of sheer gratuitous content, but it disappointed in every other way.<br /><br />Caligula attempts to transcend genres by combining a historical epic with a brazen porn flick. It fails miserably in its ambition, subjecting the audience to the worst of both worlds. The film's obvious selling point is its pornographic aspect, and it does indeed provide far more than its share of real, graphic sex. But in setting this sex in the context of Caligula's depraved reign, it dignifies the act even less than the average adult movie. Sex without context might at least be physically pleasurable for the consenting adults involved, but pleasure and perhaps even consent are largely absent from the world of Caligula. In it, sex at best serves as an idle pastime and at worst as an instrument of sadistic domination. In the present day, it is somewhat common to hear words like ""sin"" and ""depravity"" used facetiously to describe acts which are enjoyable yet considered taboo according to certain moral or religious perspectives. Caligula takes the viewer beyond the facetiousness by depicting true depravity and demonstrating that no joy or pleasure comes from it.<br /><br />The historical portions not only fail to meaningfully contextualize the sex, they fail to entertain, enlighten, intrigue, or interest the viewer in any way. They only provide lengthy stretches of unremitting tedium. Rarely has a film proved so boring. The sex, after the initial shock and astonishment fades, only contributes to the overall monotony of the picture.<br /><br />Rarely do discussions of this film involve its violence. While many films more violent than Caligula have been made, few can rival it in terms of the shock value of its violence. Apparenly, unrelenting barbarity as well as hyper-depraved sexuality characterized Caligula's emperorship. The violence is even less for the faint of heart than the sex.<br /><br />A review like this will likely generate as much curiosity as it quells. I understand why someone would want to see this film; after all, I myself succumbed to the same curiosity. I simply hope that my review, by plainly describing its lack of redeeming value, will at least give potential viewers the knowledge to make an informed decision about whether to see it or not. My high school criminal justice teacher described police work as ""hours of boredom punctuated by moments of sheer terror."" This statement perfectly describes Caligula.

"It's rare to see film that strikes out in every aspect but ""Caligula"" surely must hold this title. I'm not sure what is more horrendous; the violence, the sexual perverseness, the acting or the plot (or severe lack thereof).<br /><br />The two and a half hours basically follows the ascension of the infamous Roman Caesar ""Caligula"" to to throne in 37AD and shows the atrocities and perverseness he supposedly committed whilst in power. The acting is lifeless and dull - but that's just the tip of the iceberg. Obviously knowing that this film was severely lacking of anything legitimately interesting, the directors decided to throw in as much nudity and orgy scenes as was conceivably possible. But don't be fooled, these scenes don't ease or take focus away from the hideousness of this film. The camera work is shoddy, dialog is laughable in fact you'd have to congratulate Malcolm McDowell (playing Caligula) for keeping a straight face through such farcical lines. And then there's the violence....<br /><br />If you are about to see the film be prepared. Some atrocities are committed in the film (not just through the writing) but through disgusting violent acts which are of little point or purpose other than to repulse the viewer. This is only objective this movie achieved. One must wonder how the makers of this film thought that bestiality, necrophilia and castration (just to name a few) would be appealing to anyone.

"Some describe CALIGULIA as ""the"" most controversial film of its era. While this is debatable, it is certainly one of the most embarrassing: virtually every big name associated with the film made an effort to distance themselves from it. Author Gore Vidal actually sued (with mixed results) to have his name removed from the film, and when the stars saw the film their reactions varied from loudly voiced disgust to strategic silence. What they wanted, of course, was for it to go away.<br /><br />For a while it looked like it might. CALIGULA was a major box-office and critical flop (producer Guccione had to rent theatres in order to get it screened at all), and although the film was released on VHS to the home market so many censorship issues were raised that it was re-edited, and the edited version was the only one widely available for more than a decade. But now CALIGULIA is on DVD, available in both edited ""R"" and original ""Unrated"" versions. And no doubt John Gielgud is glad he didn't live to see it happen.<br /><br />The only way to describe CALIGULIA is to say it is something like DEEP THROAT meets David Lynch's DUNE by way of Fellini having an off day. Vidal's script fell into the hands of Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione, who used Vidal's reputation to bankroll the project and lure the big name stars--and then threw out most of Vidal's script and brought in soft-porn director Tinto Brass. Then, when Guccione felt Brass' work wasn't explicit enough, he and Giancarlo Lui photographed hardcore material on the sly.<br /><br />Viewers watching the edited version may wonder what all the fuss is about, but those viewing the original cut will quickly realize that it leaves absolutely nothing to the imagination. There is a tremendous amount of nudity, and that remains in the edited version, but the original comes complete with XXX scenes: there is very explicit gay, lesbian, and straight sex, kinky sex, and a grand orgy complete with dancing Roman guards thrown in for good measure. The film is also incredibly violent and bloody, with rape, torture, and mutilation the order of the day. In one particularly disturbing scene, a man is slowly stabbed to death, a woman urinates on his corpse, and his genitals are cut off and thrown to the dogs.<br /><br />In a documentary that accompanies the DVD release, Guccione states he wanted the film to reflect the reality of pagan Rome. If so, he missed the mark. We know very little about Caligula--and what little we know is questionable at best. That aside, orgies and casual sex were not a commonplace of Roman society, where adultery was an offense punishable by death. And certainly ancient Rome NEVER looked like the strange, slightly Oriental, oddly space-age sets and costumes offered by the designers.<br /><br />On the plus side, those sets and costumes are often fantastically beautiful, and although the cinematography is commonplace it at least does them justice; the score is also very, very good. The most successful member of the cast is Helen Mirren, who manages to engage our interests and sympathies as the Empress Caesonia; Gielgud and O'Toole also escape in reasonably good form. The same cannot be said for McDowell, but in justice to him he doesn't have much to work with.<br /><br />The movie does possess a dark fascination, but ultimately it is an oddity, more interesting for its design and flat-out weirdness than for content. Some of the bodies on display (including McDowell's and Mirren's) are extremely beautiful, and some of the sex scenes work very well as pornography... but then again, some of them are so distasteful they might drive you to abstinence, and the bloody and grotesque nature of the film undercuts its eroticism. If you're up to it, it is worth seeing once, but once is likely to be enough.<br /><br />Gary F.

"As I read the script on-line, I thought ""Capote"" needed a trim. Having just seen it on PPV, I can tell you it wasn't trimmed, it was butchered like that poor family! Example: in the script, Truman dubs Shawn ""Adorable One""; here, he is ""Mr. Shawn"".<br /><br />Bad enough the amateurs behind this movie de-flame Capote and bash his circle (are we to really believe they thought so little of Nelle, they mangled her little opus like an obnoxious in-joke?), they turn Perry Smith into this oh-so-sensitive victim, even as he's shown dispatching the Clutters. It's one thing to fudge the facts, it's another to drop the ball: the executions were carried out between 12:45-1:19 AM, April 14; Truman is shown at the prison 22 HOURS LATER!<br /><br />I was totally underwhelmed by the ""acting"". Keener doesn't even try to sound like an Alabama native. The way Cooper kept shouting ""Alvin!"", I was waiting for the Chimpmunks to show up! Hoffman gives us not the charming gadfly, but a pathetic suck-up who sees an horrific act as his ticket to the big time.

"In this film, we're invited to observe the descent into a moral and emotional funk of someone who isn't likable to start with. What was the point of making the film, then? To show that it would have been better not to have had IN COLD BLOOD - a book I admire, incidentally - in order to have kept our hero's integrity intact? Hardly. He behaves at the party at the start of the film exactly in the same way he behaves after his triumphant reading from the book, so his degradation is a matter of degree. Are we supposed to care enough about Capote to take seriously his claim that he and murderer Perry Smith are kindred spirits, with the former having had all the breaks while the latter had none? Mr Capote's plight didn't touch me at all, I'm afraid, so if that was the central idea it was wasted on me. But even if I could fathom why the filmmakers visited this pointless project on us, the clunky storytelling would still have bored me as it did. Hoffman gives a bravura performance to no emotional effect, while Keener and Cooper are so warm and interesting that I was yearning for more of them.

"This is one dreary, inert, self-important bore. When the only thing that suddenly gives a film life is a hanging, you know the venture is botched. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays Truman Capote as a narcissistic, tic-ridden, self-indulgent, cartoon-voiced, insect-like caricature. Why he is this way is never explained and we get scant background information. The script focuses on Capote's writing of 'In Cold Blood' and his attachment to the damaged brothers who murdered a family of four. The acclaimed writer of 'To Kill A Mockingbird', Harper Lee (Catherine Keener), accompanies Capote in his initial inquires into the crime, and her presence immediately suggests a far more interesting subject for a biopic. Unfortunately, Lee is quickly sidelined in favor of endless scenes of Capote bemoaning his pained existence. Watching him is like watching Dr. Smith from 'Lost in Space' complain about his ""delicate back"" to anybody who will listen for two hours. The difference, however, is that Smith was fun to watch while Capote is not. The film's precious self-importance kills it, as does director Bennett Miller's reluctance to add any kind of shading. Like the morose piano score, the film is a one note wonder, providing no contrast, no emotional coloring, and no intimate drama. If Capote really was this irritating, why make a film about him and expect audiences to watch it? Though the supporting roles are well performed (Chris Cooper is his usual stalwart self), they serve such little dramatic purpose because, ultimately, it's all about Capote(!) Director Bennett and screenwriter Dan Futterman fail to emotionally engage their intended audience because they were clearly overwhelmed by the cultural baggage of Capote's ""legend"". Their product is stillborn Oscar bait...and is more evidence that one great genre pic has more ""truth"" in it than a dozen piles of oh-so-sincere crap like this.",0,one dreari inert self import bore thing suddenli give film life hang know ventur botch philip seymour hoffman play truman capot narcissist tic ridden self indulg cartoon voic insect like caricatur way never explain get scant background inform script focus capot write cold blood attach damag brother murder famili four acclaim writer kill mockingbird harper lee catherin keener accompani capot initi inquir crime presenc immedi suggest far interest subject biopic unfortun lee quickli sidelin favor endless scene capot bemoan pain exist watch like watch dr smith lost space complain delic back anybodi listen two hour differ howev smith fun watch capot not film preciou self import kill director bennett miller reluct add kind shade like moros piano score film one note wonder provid no contrast no emot color no intim drama capot realli irrit make film expect audienc watch though support role well perform chri cooper usual stalwart self serv littl dramat purpos ultim capot director bennett screenwrit dan futterman fail emot engag intend audienc clearli overwhelm cultur baggag capot legend product stillborn oscar bait evid one great genr pic truth dozen pile oh sincer crap like

When all we have anymore is pretty much reality TV shows with people making fools of themselves for whatever reason be it too fat or can't sing or cook worth a damn than I know Hollywood has run out of original ideas. I can not recall a time when anything original or intelligent came out on TV in the last 15 years. What is our obsession with watching bums make fools of themselves? I would have thought these types of programs would have run full circle but every year they come up with something new that is more strange then the one before. OK so people in this one need to lose weight...most Americans need to lose weight. I just think we all to some degree enjoy watching people humiliated. Maybe it makes us feel better when we see someone else looking like a jerk.

"The basic genre is a thriller intercut with an uncomfortable menage-a-trois. Fellowes has tried to make a lot more out of this, using the lies of the title in order to bring about all manner of small twists, invariably designed to surprise the characters more than the audience.<br /><br />It's really rather messy though. Fellowes doesn't seem interested presenting the thriller elements in a fashion that will keep us seat-edged. Rather his focus is on the moral predicaments themselves.<br /><br />The dialogue is inconsistent, stagey here, vernacular there and with the constant surprise of realism undone by the occasional cliché-landmine. Though there is no fussing over the locations so that the actors can get on with existing in their space the dreadful score can't create a further dimension and often works against the emotional momentum of given set pieces. There's also a very prosaic, dare I say it British feel to the filming. I didn't want to see a document of two successful middle class people caught in an extraordinary situation, I wanted to see some sort of artful recounting of the story.<br /><br />Finally it is, in fact, the story which lets the rest down. Just as the elements of suspense are rather flat so the story is an asymmetric sum of subplots of different shapes and sizes, woven as a vehicle for character examination. Wilkinson and Watson support this meta-essay with good performances and John Warnaby's ebullient colleague Simon to Wilkinson is a welcome foil for much of the brow-furrowing.<br /><br />I'm disappointed; not that it's bad, but that it could have been much better. 3/10",0,basic genr thriller intercut uncomfort menag troi fellow tri make lot use lie titl order bring manner small twist invari design surpris charact audienc realli rather messi though fellow seem interest present thriller element fashion keep us seat edg rather focu moral predica dialogu inconsist stagey vernacular constant surpris realism undon occasion clich landmin though no fuss locat actor get exist space dread score creat dimens often work emot momentum given set piec also prosaic dare say british feel film want see document two success middl class peopl caught extraordinari situat want see sort art recount stori final fact stori let rest element suspens rather flat stori asymmetr sum subplot differ shape size woven vehicl charact examin wilkinson watson support meta essay good perform john warnabi ebulli colleagu simon wilkinson welcom foil much brow furrow disappoint not bad could much better
"Four things intrigued me as to this film - firstly, it stars Carly Pope (of ""Popular"" fame), who is always a pleasure to watch. Secdonly, it features brilliant New Zealand actress Rena Owen. Thirdly, it is filmed in association with the New Zealand Film Commission. Fourthly, a friend recommended it to me. However, I was utterly disappointed. The whole storyline is absurd and complicated, with very little resolution. Pope's acting is fine, but Owen is unfortunately under-used. The other actors and actresses are all okay, but I am unfamiliar with them all. Aside from the nice riddles which are littered throughout the movie (and Pope and Owen), this film isn't very good. So the moral of the story is...don't watch it unless you really want to.",0,four thing intrigu film firstli star carli pope popular fame alway pleasur watch secdonli featur brilliant new zealand actress rena owen thirdli film associ new zealand film commiss fourthli friend recommend howev utterli disappoint whole storylin absurd complic littl resolut pope act fine owen unfortun use actor actress okay unfamiliar asid nice riddl litter throughout movi pope owen film good moral stori watch unless realli want
"David Bryce's comments nearby are exceptionally well written and informative as almost say everything I feel about DARLING LILI. This massive musical is so peculiar and over blown, over produced and must have caused ruptures at Paramount in 1970. It cost 22 million dollars! That is simply irresponsible. DARLING LILI must have been greenlit from a board meeting that said ""hey we got that Pink Panther guy and that Sound Of Music gal... lets get this too"" and handed over a blank cheque. The result is a hybrid of GIGI, ZEPPELIN, HALF A SIXPENCE, some MGM 40s song and dance numbers of a style (daisies and boaters!) so hopelessly old fashioned as to be like musical porridge, and MATA HARI dramatics. The production is colossal, lush, breathtaking to view, but the rest: the ridiculous romance, Julie looking befuddled, Hudson already dead, the mistimed comedy, and the astoundingly boring songs deaden this spectacular film into being irritating. LILI is like a twee 1940s mega musical with some vulgar bits to spice it up. STAR! released the year before sadly crashed and now is being finally appreciated for the excellent film is genuinely is... and Andrews looks sublime, mature, especially in the last half hour......but LILI is POPPINS and DOLLY frilly and I believe really killed off the mega musical binge of the 60s..... and made Andrews look like Poppins again... which I believe was not Edwards intention. Paramount must have collectively fainted when they saw this: and with another $20 million festering in CATCH 22, and $12 million in ON A CLEAR DAY and $25 million in PAINT YOUR WAGON....they had a financial abyss of CLEOPATRA proportions with $77 million tied into 4 films with very uncertain futures. Maybe they should have asked seer Daisy Gamble from ON A CLEAR DAY ......LILI was very popular on immediate first release in Australia and ran in 70mm cinemas for months but it failed once out in the subs and the sticks and only ever surfaced after that on one night stands with ON A CLEAR DAY as a Sunday night double.
